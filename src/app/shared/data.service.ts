Mercy is compassionate love.</p><p>Mercy usually shows itself as two movements: \"heart\" and \"arms.\" The first movement is one of <em>the heart</em>. In other words, when we see someone who is suffering, our heart is moved with pity for that person. In fact, when the suffering of the other is particularly great, it's not just our heart that's moved, but the feeling of compassion reaches deep down into our guts.</p><p>The second movement of mercy is a movement of <em>the arms</em>. In other words, after we feel compassion for someone, we often find ourselves reaching out to help them, reaching out to alleviate their suffering. For instance, when we see a friend who is weighed down with grief, we often reach out to embrace and comfort him.</p><p>So, mercy is to feel compassion at the suffering of others and to reach out to help them.</p>"

                description: "<p>Divine Mercy is God's love for those who suffer, a love that reaches all the way back to the creation of the universe. How is creation a response to suffering? According to St. Thomas Aquinas, one of the greatest sufferings is not to exist. Thus, in creating, God lovingly relieved all creation of its suffering from non-existence.</p><p>Of course, there are many other kinds of suffering than not existing. The greatest suffering, even greater than the suffering of not existing, is sin and its punishment, eternal death. To save us from sin and death, God established a covenant with his chosen people, the Jews, and revealed Himself to them and to us as a God of mercy. In fact, God's revelation of Himself to Moses prompted the leader of the Exodus to proclaim, \"Yahweh, Yahweh, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness\" (Ex 34:5-6). Then, when the fullness of time came, God's greatest act of mercy was to send His only begotten Son to become man and suffer death for fallen humanity. Thus, Jesus Christ is Divine Mercy Incarnate. He is Mercy. He is The Divine Mercy.</p><p>All that Jesus does for us and our salvation is mercy. His sacrifice on the Cross, made present in an unbloody way at every Mass, has the power not only to cleanse us of sin but to raise us up to share in God's own divine life. (See 2 Peter 1:4.) To receive this wondrous mercy, we simply need to be baptized, repent of our sins, and believe in Jesus Christ. This truly is the Gospel, the \"good news.\" As the<em> Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> teaches, \"The Gospel is the revelation in Jesus Christ of God's mercy to sinners\" (#1846).</p><p>For more information, read <a href=\"http://thedivinemercy.org/news/story.php?NID=2985\">\"What Does 'Divine Mercy' Actually Mean?\" By Dr. Robert Stackpole</a>.</p>"

                name: "What is the Message of Divine Mercy?",
                description: "<p>What is popularly known as the Divine Mercy message and devotion is probably the largest grassroots movement in the history of the Catholic Church. It began in Poland with a seemingly ordinary nun, who lived at the beginning of the 20th century. Her name is St. Maria Faustina Kowalska.</p><p>Like St. Margaret Mary Alacoque before her, St. Faustina received visions from Jesus Christ that revealed the unfathomable mercy of His Heart. In obedience to her spiritual director, she recorded these revelations in a diary, which is now the main source for the modern message of Divine Mercy, a message that does not contradict the teachings of Sacred Scripture and the Catholic Church but reaffirms and reiterates them. Jesus chose to reemphasize the truth of His mercy in our time, because, as Pope John Paul II pointed out, the modern world is in such great need of mercy.</p><p>Five forms of devotion go with the message of Divine Mercy. (You can learn more about them in \"The Devotion\" section of this app.) These five forms are easy to remember. All you have to do is keep in mind one simple bird, or rather, one simple word: <em>finch.</em></p><i><p><strong>F</strong> = Feast of Mercy<br /><strong>I </strong>= Image of Divine Mercy<br /><strong>N</strong> = Novena to Divine Mercy<br /><strong>C</strong> = Chaplet<br /><strong>H</strong> = Hour of Great Mercy</p></i><p>But Divine Mercy isn't just a devotion. It's a way of life. And like the forms of the Divine Mercy devotion, the spirituality of Divine Mercy is also easy to remember. All you have to do is keep in mind your ABCs:</p><i><p><strong>A</strong> = Ask for mercy.<br /><strong>B</strong> = Be merciful in deed, word, and prayer.<br /><strong>C</strong> = Completely trust in Jesus.</p></i><p>Let's look at these mercy ABC's more closely.</p><p><strong>A = Ask for His Mercy</strong></p><p> Through the passion and death of Jesus, an infinite ocean of mercy was made available for all of us. But God, who created us free, will not force anything on us, not even His mercy. He waits for us to turn from our sinfulness. He tells us, \"Ask and it will be given to you, for everyone who asks receives\" (Mt 7:7, 8).</p><p>The Scriptures are filled with examples of how to trust in God and ask for His mercy: the psalms; the faith of Abraham and Moses who pleaded and \"bargained\" with God; the man who persuaded his friend to get up in the middle of the night to lend him some bread; the persistent widow who secured justice from the unjust judge; the Canaanite woman who \"argued\" with Jesus about her right to His mercy; and the witness of Mary, whose appeal for mercy at Cana led Jesus to perform His first public miracle.</p><p>Pope John Paul II echoes this scriptural message with a new urgency for our own times:</p><i><p>At no time, especially at a moment as critical as our own, can the Church forget the prayer that is a cry for the mercy of God. The Church has the right and the duty to appeal to the God of mercy \"with loud cries\" (<em>Rich in Mercy</em>,15).</p></i><p> To St. Faustina, Jesus revealed this same message once again. He gave her three new ways to ask for mercy on the strength of His passion: the Chaplet, the Novena, and prayer at three o'clock; and He taught her to transform her daily life into a continuous prayer for mercy. Through her, He calls us all to ask for His mercy:</p><i><p><strong>Souls that make an appeal to My mercy delight Me. To such souls I grant even more graces than they ask. I cannot punish even the greatest sinner if he makes an appeal to My compassion </strong>(<em>Diary</em>,1146). <strong>Beg for mercy for the whole world </strong>(570). <strong>No soul that has called upon My mercy has ever been disappointed </strong>(1541). </p></i><p><strong>B = Be merciful in deed, word, and prayer.</strong></p><p> Mercy is love that seeks to relieve the misery of others. It is an active love, poured out upon others to heal, to comfort, to console, to forgive, to remove pain. It is the love that God offers us, and it is the love He demands from us for each other: \"I give you a new commandment. As I have loved you, so you must love one another\" (Jn 13:34). \"Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful\" (Lk 6:36).</p><p>Repeatedly the Scriptures remind us that the measure we use for others is the measure God will use for us (Lk 6:38), for He will indeed \"forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us\" (Mt 6:12-14). \"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy\" (Mt 5:7), but \"judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy\" (Jas 2:13). The parables of the Good Samaritan, the Rich Man and Lazarus, and the Unforgiving Servant all demonstrate this essential truth that only if we give mercy can we hope to receive it; for we will be judged on the basis of our merciful actions toward others: \"I was hungry and you gave me food\" (Mt 25:35-46).</p><p>Our Lord spoke to St. Faustina about the importance of deeds of mercy on several occasions. For instance, he said to her:</p><i><p><strong>I demand from you deeds of mercy which are to arise out of love for Me. You are to show mercy to your neighbors always and everywhere. You must not shrink from this or try to excuse yourself from it. Even the strongest faith is of no avail without works </strong>(<em>Diary, </em>742)<strong>. If a soul does not exercise mercy in some way, it will not obtain My mercy on the day of judgment </strong>(1317).</p></i><p>In His mercy, Jesus explains to St. Faustina how to exercise mercy:</p><i><p><strong>I am giving you three ways of exercising mercy toward your neighbor: the first,  by deed, the second, by word, the third, by prayer. In these three degrees is contained the fullness of mercy, and it is an unquestionable proof of love for Me. By this means a soul glorifies and pays reverence to My mercy </strong>(742).<strong></strong></p></i><p> Later, St. Faustina elaborated on these three \"degrees\" of mercy in the following passage from her <em>Diary</em>:</p><i><p>The first: the act of mercy, of whatever kind. The second: the word of mercy, if I cannot carry out a work of mercy, I will assist by my words. The third: prayer, if I cannot show mercy by deeds or words, I can always do so by prayer. My prayer reaches out even there where I cannot reach out physically (163).</p></i><p> So, how do we exercise mercy? Through our actions, our words, and our prayers, and by developing an attitude of mercy in our daily lives. Every day we can choose to respond to the people and events we encounter by immersing them in the ocean of God's mercy. And let's not forget to pray especially for the dying, remembering Jesus' words to St. Faustina:</p><i><p><strong>Pray as much as you can for the dying. By your entreaties, obtain for them trust in My mercy, because they have most need of trust, and have it the least. Be assured that the grace of eternal salvation for certain souls in their final moments depends on your prayer </strong>(1777).</p></i><p>Jesus recommended to St. Faustina to use the Chaplet of Divine Mercy to aid the dying: </p><i><p><strong>At the hour of their death, I defend as My own glory every soul that will say this Chaplet; or when others say it for a dying person, the indulgence </strong>[pardon] <strong>is the same </strong>(811).</p></i><p><strong>C = Completely trust in Jesus</strong></p><p> Trust in Jesus is the essence of the message of mercy. When we go to a public fountain, we can draw water from it as long as we have a vessel or container of some kind to put the water in. If our vessel is small, we can only bring back a little water; if it's large, we can bring back a lot. And anyone with a vessel can draw water from the fountain. The water is there for us, and no one is excluded. All we need is a vessel.</p><p>So it is with God's mercy. In repeated revelations to St. Faustina, our Divine Savior makes it clear that the fountain is His Heart, the water is His mercy, and the vessel is trust:</p><i><p><strong>I have opened My Heart as a living fountain of mercy. Let all souls draw life from it. Let them approach this sea of mercy with great trust </strong>(<em>Diary</em>, 1520). <strong>On the cross, the fountain of My mercy was opened wide by the lance for all souls--no one have I excluded! </strong>(1182). <strong>I am offering people a vessel with which they are to keep coming for graces to the fountain of mercy. That vessel is this image with the signature: \"Jesus, I trust in You\" </strong>(327). <strong>The graces of My mercy are drawn by means of one vessel only, and that is trust. The more a soul trusts, the more it will receive </strong>(1578)<strong>.</strong></p></i><p> In the <em>Diary of St. Faustina</em>,we hear our Lord reminding us that we can depend upon His love and that He alone is worthy of our trust:</p><i><p><strong>I never reject a contrite heart </strong>(1485). <strong>Sooner would heaven and earth turn into nothingness than would My mercy not embrace a trusting soul </strong>(1777).</p></i><p> But there is more to trust than just believing that God is trustworthy. We have to act upon that belief. Trust involves a turning back to God, a real conversion of our whole lives to God, repenting of our sins and forgiving others. Trust is a living faith.</p><p>Trust means that we agree to let God be God, instead of trying to be God ourselves. (Trust is the antidote to the first sin of Adam.) It means that we agree that God can write the script of our lives, instead of insisting on our own script. It means that we agree with the great pledge we make in the Our Father: \"Your will [not mine] be done on earth as it is in heaven.\" It means that even in our moments of agony we agree with the cry of Jesus in the Garden, \"Not my will, but Yours be done\" (Lk 22:42).</p><p>God is Mercy itself, and we are called to practice the ABC's of mercy. As we do, our trust in Jesus is the vital ingredient. We don't simply ask for mercy, nor do we simply try to be good to other people. We ask with complete trust, and Our Lord fills us with grace so that we can be merciful as our Heavenly Father is merciful.</p><i><p><strong>I am Love and Mercy itself. When a soul approaches Me with trust, I fill it with such an abundance of graces that it cannot contain them within itself, but radiates them to other souls </strong>(1074).</p></i>"

                name: "Why Should We Listen to St. Faustina?",
                description: "<p>We should listen to the message of mercy that comes to us through St. Faustina because she's a prophet, recognized as such by the Church. That may be enough for you. However, if you need some more convincing, read on.</p><p>Jesus is alive and speaks to us today. Of course, He, and also the Holy Spirit, speaks to us whenever we hear or read His Word, that is, Sacred Scripture. Yet He can also speak to us in many other ways such as through people, events, and through the peace and joy He puts in our hearts. Some of the people through whom God speaks to us are the prophets. Of course, we've all heard of prophets in the Old Testament, people such as Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Ezekiel. Yet we may be surprised to learn that there have been prophets throughout the Church's history, even up to our own day. (The surprise often comes despite St. Paul's letters about the charism of prophecy in the life of the Church: See Eph 2:20; 4:11-12; 1 Cor 14:1-5, 22-25, 29-32.) In fact, even though they aren't frequently thought of as prophets, well-known saints such as Francis of Assisi, Ignatius of Loyola, Therese of Liseiux, Faustina Kowalska, and Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta truly had prophetic missions. In other words, they (and many other saintly people) had powerful experiences of God that they were then called to share at a given time for the strengthening of other people's faith, hope, and love. Sometimes their experiences of God came through extraordinary mystical experiences, as in the case of St. Faustina. At other times, their experiences came through the silent, hidden action of the Holy Spirit, such as in the case of St. Therese. Whatever the nature of his experience of God, if a prophet is authentic, of which only the Church has the authority to make a final, definitive determination, then his experience becomes a gift for the people of his time.</p><p>Now, St. Faustina is a powerful prophetic witness for our day. Pope John Paul II makes this point in the following excerpt from his homily on the occasion of the dedication of the Shrine of Divine Mercy in Krakow Lagiewniki on August 17, 2002:</p><i><p>Today, therefore, in this Shrine, I wish <em>solemnly to entrust the world to Divine Mercy</em>. I do so with the burning desire that the message of God's merciful love, proclaimed here through Saint Faustina, <em>may be made known to all the peoples of the earth </em>and fill their hearts with hope. May this message radiate from this place to our beloved homeland and throughout the world. May the binding promise of the Lord Jesus be fulfilled: from here there must go forth \"the spark which will prepare the world for his final coming\" (cf. <em>Diary</em>, 1732). This spark needs to be lighted by the grace of God. This fire of mercy needs to be passed on to the world. <em>In the mercy of God the world will find peace and mankind will find happiness! </em>(emphasis in original; 5).</p></i><p> Having said that the charism of prophecy has been alive and active in the life of the Church through the ages, an important point can be made: The words of post-Biblical prophets do not carry the same weight as Divine Revelation, which is communicated to us through Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition. Thus, we should always consider the words of prophetic saints in light of Divine Revelation and keep in mind that their words do not contain the same fullness of authority as, for instance, the words of Jesus in the Gospels or the teachings of the Magisterium of the Church. Still, the Church may decide that the prophetic testimony of a saint (or group of saints) contributes to and comprises a part of Sacred Tradition (for instance, when a saint is made a Doctor of the Church). The testimony of such a saint would then have greater weight. On this topic, it may be helpful to meditate on words from the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation, <em>Dei Verbum </em>(8) as it teaches about the role of believers in the development of Sacred Tradition:</p><i><p>This Tradition which comes from the apostles develops in the Church with the help of the Holy Spirit. For there is a growth in the understanding of the realities and the words which have been handed down. <em>This happens through the contemplation and study made by believers, who treasure these things in their hearts </em>(cf. Lk 2:19, 51), <em>through a penetrating understanding of the realities which they experience</em>, and through the preaching of those who have received through Episcopal succession the sure gift of truth. For as the centuries succeed one another, the Church constantly moves forward toward the fullness of divine truth until the words of God reach their complete fulfillment in her (emphasis added; cited from <em>The Sixteen Documents of Vatican II </em>ed. Marianne Lorraine Trouve. Boston: Pauline Books and Media, 1999).</p></i><p>For an excellent and thorough study of prophecy and its role in the life of the Church, see Niels Christian Hvidt's <em>Christian Prophecy: The Post Biblical Tradition </em>(Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press, 2007).</p>"

                name: "Why the Marians and Divine Mercy?",
                description: "<p>This app is brought to you by the Congregation of the Marian Fathers of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Why the Marians? What's their connection with Divine Mercy?</p><p>The Marians of the Immaculate Conception have been promoters of the authentic message of Divine Mercy since 1941, which is barely three years after the death of St. Faustina. How this became their role is an amazing story, and it starts with St. Faustina's spiritual director, Blessed Michael Sopocko.</p><p>After her death, Fr. Sopocko had possession of Sr. Faustina's writings on Divine Mercy and desired to promote them. However, he couldn't do so in Poland because first the Soviets, and then the Nazis, had occupied the country since September 1939, just a year after Faustina's death. So, when Fr. Sopocko heard that a young priest was going to try to escape to the U.S.A., he entrusted the young priest with some of Faustina's writings on Divine Mercy. That priest's name was Fr. Joseph Jarzebowski, and he belonged to the Congregation of Marian Fathers of the Immaculate Conception.</p><p>Fr. Joseph entrusted himself and his mission to The Divine Mercy, and he vowed to spend the rest of his life spreading the mercy message and devotion if he were to reach safety. His daring journey took him through the desolate wastelands of Russia, the rice fields of Japan, and finally on the long ocean voyage across the Pacific to Seattle. From Seattle, without speaking a word of English, Fr. Joseph made his way across the U.S.A. to Washington, D.C., where a Marian house had been founded in 1922.</p><p>When the Marian community in Washington, D.C., learned about Fr. Joseph's amazing journey, they believed him when he exclaimed that it was a miracle of Divine Mercy. At Fr. Joseph's prompting, the Marian community in D.C., with the help of Felician Sisters, began to publish and distribute the message of Divine Mercy.</p><p>The message spread quickly. Eventually, the Marians' little publishing operation in D.C. couldn't keep up with the huge demand for Divine Mercy materials. Moreover, the community was rapidly growing. So, one of the Marians, Fr. Walter Pelczynski, organized the purchase of a property for the Marian community on Eden Hill in Stockbridge, MA, and founded the Mercy of God Apostolate. From Eden Hill, that Mercy of God Apostolate, which later became the Association of Marian Helpers, spread the message of Divine Mercy throughout the world. Also, in 1950, the Marians began construction of a beautiful Shrine to Divine Mercy.</p><p>In 1959, the Vatican banned the message of Divine Mercy because of a faulty translation and lack of original documents. This was a time of great suffering for the Marian community as they experienced persecution due to their previous efforts to spread the message. Being obedient to the Church, they destroyed or locked up all of their Divine Mercy materials associated with Sr. Faustina. Then, in 1978, when the Vatican was able to examine Sr. Faustina's original writings, Pope Paul VI lifted the ban and the Marians continued right where they had left off. One of their priests, Fr. Seraphim Michalenko, was particularly zealous for Divine Mercy. Through his initiative, the entire <em>Diary of St. Faustina</em> was translated into English and published in both English and Polish. Furthermore, Fr. Michalenko was instrumental in the canonization cause of Faustina, who was declared the first saint of the new millennium by Pope John Paul II on April 30, 2000. </p><p>To date, the Marians of the Immaculate Conception have published nearly one million copies of the <em>Diary of St. Faustina </em>and about 200 million pamphlets and holy cards on the message of Divine Mercy. More than anyone, they have helped fuel \"the greatest grassroots movement in the history of the Church,\" the spread of the beautiful message of God's merciful love. And now, they are pleased to bring the fullness of that message to mobile devices. Their hope and prayer is that this app will help everyone who uses it to draw closer to the merciful Heart of Jesus.</p>"

                description: "<p>Helena Kowalska was born in the little rural village of Glogowiec, Poland, in 1905. As early as the age of seven, she heard the voice of the Lord in her soul, calling her to a more perfect way of life. As a result, just before her 20th birthday with hardly a penny to her name and without her parents' permission, she journeyed alone by rail to Warsaw to pursue the religious life. A year later, she entered the convent of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy.</p> <p>Over the next few years, Sr. Maria Faustina of the Most Blessed Sacrament (Helena's religious name) deepened her life of prayer and grew strong in her practice of the Christian virtues. She regularly performed the most menial tasks for her community: cook, gardener, and porter, for example. But she was noted especially for her cheerfulness, for her care for the poor who came to the convent seeking food, and for her loving kindness to the girls whom the sisters trained and educated in their houses. In fact, many of the sisters knew of her desire for holiness, and so they trusted her and came to her for counsel and advice, so much so that she earned the nickname \"the dump,\" because they were always \"dumping\" their problems on her.</p><p>After an intense period of spiritual purification that occurred early in her life as a religious, our Lord brought her into a special intimacy with His merciful Heart. She began to receive mystical revelations, visions, locutions, and prophecies, all focused on the same theme: the mercy of the Lord for the lost and the broken. At the command of her spiritual director, she recorded her spiritual experiences in her <em>Diary</em>, which is now regarded as an outstanding spiritual classic of the 20th century and a miracle in itself, given that Sr. Faustina had barely two winters of elementary education.</p><p>Sister Faustina also bore many sufferings: the tuberculosis which gradually ravaged her body, the uncharitable misinterpretation of her growing physical weakness by many of her fellow sisters, her anguish about her own seeming inability to carry out the Lord's requests to her. He had asked her to initiate several forms of devotion to His Divine Mercy throughout the world, that a wayward and wounded mankind, already headed for a second world war, might soon learn to ask for His mercy, completely trust in His mercy, and be merciful to others, as He is merciful.</p><p>Sister Faustina offered up all her prayers, works, and sufferings, in union with the crucified Jesus, for mercy upon poor sinners, especially those who have lost their trust in God's goodness. In addition, our Lord frequently appeared to her as a child, asking her to learn from Him the lesson of spiritual childhood: to approach God with humility and trust, as a little child would do. These themes of her spiritual life echo the \"little way\" of another great mystic of modern times, St. Therese of Lisieux.</p><p>Sister Faustina died on October 5, 1938, but her mission was far from over. In fact, it was only just beginning. She wrote:</p><i><p>\"I feel certain that my mission will not come to an end upon my death, but will begin. O doubting souls, I will draw aside the veils of heaven to convince you of God's goodness\" (<em>Diary</em>, 281). </p></i><p> By her heavenly intercessions, St. Faustina has been fulfilling that promise ever since, obtaining countless graces and miracles for suffering souls from the compassionate Heart of Jesus:</p><i><p>O my Jesus, each of Your saints reflects one of Your virtues; I desire to reflect Your compassionate Heart, full of mercy; I want to glorify it. Let Your mercy, O Jesus, be impressed upon my heart and soul like a seal, and this will be my badge in this and the future life. Glorifying Your mercy is the exclusive task of my life (<em>Diary</em>, 1242).</p></i><p> Perhaps the message and mission of St. Faustina to the modern world was best summed up by the Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, in his homily for her beatification on Divine Mercy Sunday, April 18, 1993:</p><i><p>Her mission continues and is yielding astonishing fruit. It is truly marvelous how her devotion to the merciful Jesus is spreading in our contemporary world and gaining so many human hearts! This is doubtlessly a sign of the times, a sign of our twentieth century. The balance of this century, which is now ending, presents a deep restlessness and fear of the future. Where, if not in the Divine Mercy, can the world find refuge and the light of hope? Believers understand that perfectly.</p></i>"

Two days later, Stanislaus Kowalski and his wife, Marianna, took their third child to nearby Swinice, where she was baptized \"Helena\" in the parish church of St. Casimir. One of 10 children of a poor farmer and carpenter, she knew what it was to live simply in a small cottage, doing chores around the house and working on the farm. She and her sisters took turns attending Mass on Sundays, sharing the one good dress they owned.</p><p>Religion was central to the Kowalski family. Stanislaus sang out his daily prayers early in the morning before work. While his daughter was young, he taught her short prayers and how to read the lives of saints and missionaries, Helen, as she was called by her family, was a gifted storyteller. She fascinated other children by repeating the stories to them. Her mother's tender compassion and dedication to her husband and family also influenced the young girl.</p><p>Unusually drawn to spiritual pursuits, Helen was seven when she first heard a voice in her soul challenging her to a more perfect way of life (see <em>Diary</em>, 7). At the age of nine, she received her First Holy Communion.</p><p>Since Polish schools had been closed during the Russian occupation, Helen did not begin her primary education until age 12. Her schooling was cut off after two winters when officials decided to make room for younger students.</p><p>In the spring of 1921, in order to assist her parents, she went to work as a housemaid and baby-sitter in the town of Alexandrow. Her joyful spirit and natural gift of storytelling, combined with an innate skill in nurturing children, made her a favorite. Helen, however, was still drawn to a more spiritual life. After a year, she returned home and informed her parents that she wanted to join a convent. Neither paid attention to her pleas.</p><p>In the fall of 1922, Helen left home again, this time to work in Lodz. Her prayer life deepened, and she disciplined herself by fasting.

He spoke to her: <strong>How long shall I put up with you, and how long will you keep putting Me off? </strong>(<em>Diary</em>, 9).</p><p>This was the turning point in her life. She ran to the cathedral, threw herself on the floor before the altar, and begged the Lord to be good enough to let her know what she should do next (see <em>Diary</em>, 9). Then she heard these words: <strong>Go at once to Warsaw; you will enter a convent there </strong>(<em>Diary</em>, 10).</p><p>Helen went home and packed her things. When morning came, she said good-bye to her sister and uncle, who then took her to the train for Warsaw. Obedient to the word she had heard, and with only the clothes on her back, Helen set off for the city.</p><p>In Warsaw, she knew no one. After morning Mass, a priest directed her to a woman who would help with a place to stay. Helen began her search for a convent to enter, but none would accept her until she knocked at the door of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy. The Mother Superior took a liking to Helen and told her to go to the Lord of the house and ask whether He would accept her. With joy, she went to the chapel and asked the Lord Jesus, \"Do you accept me?\" She immediately heard: <strong>I do accept you; you are in My Heart. </strong>On returning to Mother Superior, who asked, \"Well, has the Lord accepted you?\" Helen answered, \"Yes.\" \"If the Lord has accepted,\" Mother responded, \"then I also will accept\" (<em>Diary</em>, 14).</p><p>Because Helen had no money for a sister's wardrobe, Mother suggested she continue working and set aside the needed funds. Helen regularly delivered her earnings to the convent. Within a year, she had enough. Helen Kowalska finally entered the convent, becoming a postulant on the eve of the Feast of Our Lady of the Angels, August 1, 1925.

But then God filled my soul again with great consolations\" (22).</p><p>In Krakow, Sr. Faustina began her two novitiate years of formal training in the work and spiritual life of the community. She was popular with the other novices. Faustina's good nature, willingness to defer to others for the sake of Jesus, and enlightening conversations drew them to her. Toward the end of her first year, she began to experience some of the suffering and struggle that became part of her life and mission. Finding neither joy nor consolation in prayer, and increasingly aware of her own sinfulness, she entered into a dark night of the soul:</p><i><p> Toward the end of the first year of my novitiate, darkness began to cast its shadow over my soul. I felt no consolation in prayer; I had to make a great effort to meditate; fear began to sweep over me. Going deeper into myself, I could find nothing but great misery. I could also clearly see the great holiness of God. I did not dare to raise my eyes to Him, but reduced myself to dust under His feet and begged for mercy. The simple truths of the faith become incomprehensible to me. My soul was in anguish, unable to find comfort anywhere.</p><p>At a certain point, there came to me the very powerful impression that I am rejected by God. This terrible thought pierced my soul right through; in the midst of the suffering my soul began to experience the agony of death. I wanted to die but could not. When I made this known to the Directress of Novices, I received this reply, \"Know, dear Sister, that God has chosen you for great sanctity. This is a sign that God wants to have you very close to Himself in Heaven. Have great trust in the Lord Jesus\" (<em>Diary</em>, 23).</p></i><p> Faustina's response to this dark night gives us the key to her spirituality and mission in the Church:</p><i><p>During these terrible moments I said to God, \"Jesus, who in the Gospel compare Yourself to a most tender mother, I trust in Your words because You are Truth and Life. In spite of everything, Jesus, I trust in You in the face of every interior sentiment which sets itself against hope. Do what You want with me; I will never leave You, because You are the source of my life\" (<em>Diary</em>, 24).</p></i><p> Near the end of her novitiate, Faustina's interior sufferings were accompanied by physical weaknesses. The Mother Directress excused her from the customary spiritual disciplines and suggested that Faustina replace them with short prayers. On Good Friday in 1928, Faustina wrote of her experience as she prayed:</p><i><p>Jesus catches up my heart into the very flame of His love. This was during the evening adoration. All of a sudden, the Divine Presence invaded me, and I forgot everything else. Jesus gave me to understand how much He had suffered for me. This lasted a very short time. An intense yearning, a longing to love God (<em>Diary</em>, 26).</p></i>"

                description: "<p>Sister Faustina's novitiate ended on April 30, 1928, when she made simple (temporary) vows for one year. The dark night lingered for six more months. Through these sufferings, Faustina grew into a deeper love of the Lord and an awareness of her own misery and God's mercy. She wrote:</p><i><p>At the beginning of my religious life, suffering and adversities frightened and disheartened me. So I prayed continuously, asking Jesus to strengthen me and to grant me the power of His Holy Spirit that I might carry out His holy will in all things, because from the beginning I have been aware of my weakness. The knowledge of my own misery allows me, at the same time, to know the immensity of Your mercy. In my own interior life, I am looking with one eye at the abyss of my misery and baseness, and with the other, at the abyss of Your mercy, O God (<em>Diary</em>, 56).</p></i><p> Six months after making her simple vows, Faustina was assigned to the convent in Warsaw where she had begun her journey into religious life. After just a month of kitchen duty, she became ill and was sent to the infirmary. At this time and throughout much of her life, Faustina suffered not only physically and from her interior struggle but also from harsh treatment by those around her. Many did not believe she was sick but thought she was pretending in order to avoid the rigors of religious life. The distrust and gossip pained her deeply.</p><p>Mother Michael, who had admitted Faustina years ago and who had since been elected Superior General of the community, told her: \"Sister, along your path, sufferings just spring up out of the ground. I look upon you, Sister, as one crucified. But I can see that Jesus has a hand in this. Be faithful to the Lord\" (<em>Diary</em>, 149).</p><p>Faustina remained faithful through the dull routine of her jobs as she was assigned to different houses. She was sometimes a cook or gardener, and a porter when she was too ill for physical work. In her <em>Diary</em>, she reflected on the blessings that even monotonous work could bring:</p><i><p>O life so dull and monotonous, how many treasures you contain! When I look at everything with the eyes of faith, no two hours are alike, and the dullness and monotony disappear. The grace which is given me in this hour will not be repeated in the next (62).</p></i><p> Because of her ready and agreeable nature, Faustina was a blessing to her superiors. They could send her wherever a need arose. They were unaware of her chronic tubercular condition that was aggravated by their demanding assignments.</p><p>In June 1930, Sr. Faustina was sent to Plock and Guardian Angel Home, where she was again assigned to kitchen duty. After a few months, the work became too physically demanding. Faustina was sent to the sisters' rest home in Biala, where she remained for the rest of the year. Once she felt better, she returned to Guardian Angel Home to work in the bakery and store. Plock would remain her home until she returned to Warsaw to prepare for perpetual vows in November 1932.</p><p>Throughout her years at Plock, Faustina was continually afflicted by illness and spiritual torment. She had found no spiritual director, and her confessors were often unable to help her. Many of her companions thought her strange. The doubts of others sowed doubt in her own heart. However, whenever she spoke to Jesus about her uncertainty or her inability to go on, He reassured her: <strong>Do not fear; I am with you </strong>(<em>Diary</em>, 129). In God's plan, this suffering and doubt perfected her trust and the obedience necessary for a mission that would prove far more demanding.</p>"

She wrote:</p><i><p>In the evening, when I was in my cell, I saw the Lord Jesus clothed in a white garment. One hand [was] raised in the gesture of blessing, the other was touching the garment at the breast. From beneath the garment, slightly drawn aside at the breast, there were emanating two large rays, one red, the other pale. In silence I kept my gaze fixed on the Lord; my soul was struck with awe, but also with great joy. After a while, Jesus said to me, <strong>Paint an image according to the pattern you see with the signature: Jesus, I trust in You. I desire that this image be venerated, first in your chapel, and [then] throughout the world </strong>(<em>Diary</em>, 470). <strong>I promise that the soul that will venerate this image will not perish. I also promise victory over </strong>[its] <strong>enemies already here on earth, especially at the hour of death. I Myself will defend it as My own glory </strong>(<em>Diary</em>, 48).</p></i><p> This was the first major revelation of Divine Mercy to Sr. Faustina. Through it, Jesus made known His great desire that all come to the rays of mercy, all come to His Heart, pierced for us and flowing with blood and water (see Jn 19:34).</p><p>Some time later, her spiritual director and confessor, Fr. Michael Sopocko, told Sr. Faustina to ask the Lord Jesus the meaning of the two rays in the image. Obediently, she recorded His response:</p><i><p>During prayer I heard these words within me: <strong>The two rays denote Blood and Water. The pale ray stands for the Water which makes souls righteous. The red ray stands for the Blood which is the life of souls. These two rays issued forth from the very depths of My tender mercy when My agonized Heart was opened by a lance on the Cross. These rays shield souls from the wrath of My Father. Happy is the one who will dwell in their shelter, for the just hand of God shall not lay hold of him </strong>(<em>Diary</em>, 299).</p></i>"

With little knowledge of gardening, she trusted God to help her in her work. She was hesitant to leave Fr. Andrasz, but Jesus assured her: <strong>Do not fear. I will not leave you alone. </strong>When she arrived on May 25, 1933, she found a place quite different than St. Joseph's. The convent consisted of a few small huts occupied by 18 sisters. Here, at last, she found her spiritual director, Rev. Michael Sopocko, who was beatified on September 28, 2008. She recognized him from her vision. He was sensitive to her deep spirituality from the first and remained so for the rest of her life.

She had not been home for 10 years. Faustina arrived and went directly to her mother. After greeting her daughter with the words, \"Praised be Jesus Christ,\" and assuring Faustina that she would be \"up and about,\" her mother sat up in bed. While her doctors had told her she could not improve without surgery, Faustina's mother was well. In fact, she lived to be 90!</p><p>Friends and neighbors filled the house and brought their children for Faustina to hold and kiss. The guests enjoyed hearing her tell stories of the saints and speak of God. While she enjoyed the visit and gave thanks for the opportunity to see her family again, she missed solitude and prayer. On her return to the convent, Jesus assured her that her time with her family had been pleasing to him.</p><p>During Lent, Jesus revealed to her that the image of The Divine Mercy should be publicly displayed and venerated. Despite his doubts about being able to arrange it, and at considerable personal expense, Fr. Sopocko had the painting displayed in a prominent window of the Ostra Brama (the Shrine of Our Lady of Mercy in Vilnius). He preached there at the three-day celebration at the end of the Jubilee Year of Redemption, 1935. This first display of the image fell on the Feast of Divine Mercy.</p><p>Faustina soon received a message from Jesus that would trouble her for most of her remaining years: He asked that she leave her congregation and begin a new community. Time after time, she asked her spiritual director and her confessors about this. Each time she was told to wait, or not to do anything without the consent of her superiors. Faustina loved her community and was not eager to leave it. However, she would do anything if she knew it was God's will. Some people believe that this prophetic sense of Faustina being called to found a community was fulfilled when Fr.

During her October retreat in Krakow, she asked her confessor, Fr. Andrasz, about forming the new community. Again, he advised against doing anything at that time. He felt Faustina's perpetual vows were a sign that God wanted her to remain in her present congregation. If she remained faithful to God and obedient to her superiors, Fr. Andrasz reassured her, the Lord would not allow her to fall into error. In later visions, Jesus also comforted her. His will would be done. She should not worry about how it would come about.</p><p>Try as she might, Faustina could not put worry over the new community out of her heart. On one hand, it seemed that Jesus was telling her to begin something new. On the other, her superiors and confessors continued to discourage immediate action. This spiritual turmoil affected her physical health. She approached the Archbishop of Vilnius, Romuald Jalbrzykowski, at the beginning of 1936 to ask his guidance. He added his voice to the others: Wait.</p><p>After a visit to Warsaw in March 1936, Faustina accepted a new assignment to a convent in Walendow. The convent was financially unstable, and the sisters were required to work long hours. Despite her poor health, Faustina was assigned difficult tasks. Her health worsened, and in late April, she was sent to Derdy, a country home for girls. Located in the forest near Walendow, it provided Faustina a place to rest and pray. However, her health continued to decline. On May 11, she returned to Warsaw, where she would be closer to doctors.</p><p>Faustina continued to have visions and conversations with Jesus.

He promised complete forgiveness of sins and of punishment to anyone who would make a good confession beforehand and receive Holy Communion on that feast.</p><p>Faustina faithfully recorded all Jesus said to her. Her suffering increased, and at the end of the month, her illness was diagnosed as tuberculosis. She was separated from the other sisters to avoid spreading the disease. However, she still had chores to do.</p><p>On her October retreat, she experienced union with God and had a vision of hell. She was also told explicit ways to worship the mercy of God: First, she must show mercy, which grows from love of God, to all her neighbors. Second, she was to show such mercy in three ways: in deed, word, and prayer.</p>"

Sometimes she would waken in the night, knowing that someone was near death and in need of prayer. As Jesus had instructed her, she prayed the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, obtaining for the person a peaceful death and the unlimited mercy of God.</p><p>Much to her delight, Faustina was permitted to return home to her convent to celebrate Christmas.

When Faustina left the meeting, a feeling of great darkness wrapped itself about her. When she confided that to Mother General, she was told that her desire to leave was a great temptation. Faustina called this dilemma an \"endless agony of the soul\" (<em>Diary</em>, 1116).</p><p>Throughout the spring and summer, Faustina continued to record Jesus' words to her. She was told that we most resemble God when we forgive one another. God is Love, Mercy, and Goodness.

There, she stayed in a rest home for girls and sisters. Her lungs were excruciatingly painful, and her health continued to worsen. She was visited with visions of Mary, Joseph, and St. Barbara. On August 10, she returned to Krakow, where she wrote down the Novena to The Divine Mercy. Father Sopocko visited her at the end of the month and told her that work on establishing a Feast of Divine Mercy was going well, as were his efforts to spread the chaplet, litany, and novena.</p><p>At Mass on the First Friday of September, having made a prayer of total abandonment to God's will, Faustina had reached a stage of holy indifference. She trusted in God completely, willing to accept whatever He required of her. </p><p>Much suffering was in store for her. Despite physical agony, Faustina still had assigned duties at the convent. Only Jesus knew the effort required to perform them. Another source of anguish came from the unkindness and suspicions of those with whom she lived. Her life was a confirmation of the letter she received from Fr. Sopocko: God required prayer and sacrifice from her. Her work would be suffering, not the action of forming a new community.</p>"

When others demanded more of her than she could physically do, she depended on Jesus' strength, given through the Blessed Sacrament, to sustain her. When she was too ill to attend Mass, she would make her way there for Holy Communion. When she was too ill for that, others brought Holy Communion to her. During her last, long stay at the sanatorium, when no one could bring her the Host, she received Holy Communion from the hands of an angel.</p><p>Faustina returned to the sanatorium in April. She was well cared for, and while there, she ministered to others as she was able by listening, prayer, and counsel. By June, Sr. Faustina was too ill to write in her <em>Diary</em>. During her last weeks, she struggled to complete her final notebook. She knew the message of mercy would spread over the whole world.</p><p>At the end of August, Faustina wrote a letter to Mother Michael, the Mother General. Faustina thanked her for all she had done, for the graces received from the community, and asked forgiveness for any offenses she had committed.</p><p>Faustina's condition grew worse. On August 25, her 33rd birthday, she received the Anointing of the Sick. Father Sopocko visited her on August 28 and again on September 2. After taking his leave, he remembered something he had left and returned to her room. He found her in ecstasy and did not disturb her.</p><p>On September 17, she was taken home to the convent to die. She lay in a private room, unable to eat. Five days later, according to custom, she formally asked pardon of the entire community. On September 29, Fr. Sopocko made his last visit.</p><p>Finally, on October 5, Fr. Andrasz heard her last confession. For much of the evening, she was surrounded by the sisters and the chaplain. After they left, at 10:45 p.m., the one sister who had remained with her ran to summon the others. Sister Faustina of the Most Blessed Sacrament looked to heaven and died, united at last with her beloved Jesus.</p><p>Her funeral Mass was held on October 7. Not wanting her family to bear the expense and suffering, Faustina had not informed them of her final illness. They were not present at her funeral. After the Mass, her coffin was carried to the common grave of the community, and there she was buried. As Faustina herself predicted, her work on earth had just begun. She would leave a lasting mission of mercy.</p><p>(From <em>Faustina: Saint for Our Times, a Personal Look at Her Life, Spirituality, and Legacy</em> by Rev. George W. Kosicki, CSB with Dave Came.

Right from the beginning of my ministry in St. Peter's See in Rome, I considered this message [of Divine Mercy] my special task. Providence has assigned it to me in the present situation of man, the Church and the world. It could be said that precisely this situation assigned that message to me as my task before God.</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Public Address at the Shrine of Merciful Love in Collevalenza, Italy on November 22, 1981.</p><p>2. It is truly marvelous how her devotion to the merciful Jesus is spreading in our contemporary world and gaining so many hearts! This is doubtlessly <em>a sign of the times </em>,<em> a sign of our 20th century. </em>The balance of this century which is now ending, in addition to the advances which have often surpassed those of preceding eras, presents a deep restlessness and fear of the future. Where, if not in The Divine Mercy, can the world find refuge and the light of hope?</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Beatification Homily of Sr. Faustina, April 18, 1993.</p><p>3. From here, in fact, went out the Message of Divine Mercy that Christ himself chose to pass on to our generation through Blessed Faustina. And it is a message that is clear and understandable for everyone. Anyone can come here, look at this picture of the Merciful Jesus, his Heart radiating grace, and hear in the depths of his own soul what Blessed Faustina heard: &quot;Fear nothing. I am with you always&quot; (<em>Diary</em>, q. II). And if this person responds with a sincere heart: &quot;Jesus, I trust in you!&quot;, he will find comfort in all his anxieties and fears. In this dialogue of abandonment, there is established between man and Christ a special bond that sets love free. And &quot;there is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear&quot; (1 Jn 4:18).</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Address to the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy at the Shrine of the Divine Mercy in Krakow-Lagiewniki, Poland on June 7, 1997.</p><p>4.

On the threshold of the Third Millennium I come to entrust to him once more my Petrine ministry. \"Jesus, I trust in you!\"</p><p>The Message of Divine Mercy has always been near and dear to me. [I took it] with me to the See of Peter and, in a sense [it] forms the image of this Pontificate. ...

Today, therefore, in this Shine, I wish <em>solemnly to entrust the world to Divine Mercy</em>. I do so with the burning desire that the message of God's merciful love, proclaimed here through Saint Faustina, <em>may be made known to all the peoples of the earth</em> and fill their hearts with hope. May this message radiate from this place to our beloved homeland and throughout the world. May the binding promise of the Lord Jesus be fulfilled: from here there must go forth \"the spark which will prepare the world for his final coming\" (cf. <em>Diary</em>, 1732). This spark needs to be lighted by the grace of God. This fire of mercy needs to be passed on to the world. <em>In the mercy of God the world will find peace and mankind will find happiness</em>!</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Homily at Dedication of Shrine of Divine Mercy in Krakow-Lagiewniki on August 17, 2002. </p><p>8. <em>We today have been particularly called</em> to proclaim this message [of Divine Mercy] before the world.

[ I]t is as if Christ, using the testimony of a lowly Sister, entered our time in order to indicate clearly the source of relief and hope found in the eternal mercy of God. <em>The message of merciful love needs to resound forcefully anew</em>. The world needs this love. The hour has come to bring Christ's message to everyone.

As a gift to humanity, which sometimes seems bewildered and overwhelmed by the power of evil, selfishness and fear, the Risen Lord offers his love that pardons, reconciles and reopens hearts to love.

There is nothing that man needs more than Divine Mercy. We have a greater need than ever for a regenerating experience of mercy. We wish to proclaim that apart from the mercy of God there is no other source of hope for mankind. How greatly today's world needs God's mercy! How much the world needs to understand and accept Divine Mercy!</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Compiled from various Papal Addresses from 1994-2005.</p><p><strong>Saint John Paul II Defines Mercy</strong></p><p><em>1. Mercy restores value and brings good out of evil.</em></p><p>Mercy is manifested in its true and proper aspect when it restores to value, promotes and draws good from all the forms of evil existing in the world and in man. Understood in this way, mercy constitutes the fundamental content of the messianic message of Christ and the constitutive power of His mission. His disciples and followers understood and practiced mercy in the same way. Mercy never ceased to reveal itself, in their hearts and in their actions, as an especially creative proof of the love which does not allow itself to be \"conquered by evil,\" but overcomes \"evil with good.\" (See Rom 12:21.) The genuine face of mercy has to be ever revealed anew. In spite of many prejudices, mercy seems particularly necessary for our times (<em>Rich in Mercy</em>,6).</p><p><em>2. Mercy is love when it meets suffering.</em></p><p> The truth, revealed in Christ, about God the \"Father of mercies,\" (2 Cor 1:3) enables us to \"see\" Him as particularly close to man especially when man is suffering, when he is under threat at the very heart of his existence and dignity (<em>Rich in Mercy</em>, 2).<strong></strong></p><p>This love makes itself particularly noticed in contact with suffering, injustice and poverty, in contact with the whole historical \"human condition,\" which in various ways manifests man's limitation and frailty, both physical and moral. It is precisely the mode and sphere in which love manifests itself that in biblical language is called \"mercy\" (3).</p><p>[Christ is the] incarnation of the love that is manifested with particular force with regard to the suffering, the unfortunate and sinners, makes present and thus more fully reveals the Father, who is God \"rich in mercy\" (3).</p><p>In the preaching of the prophets, mercy signifies a special power of love, which prevails over the sin and infidelity of the chosen people (4).</p><p>In the eschatological fulfillment mercy will be revealed as love, while in the temporal phase, in human history, which is at the same time the history of sin and death, love must be revealed above all as mercy and must also be actualized as mercy (8).</p><p>For mercy is an indispensable dimension of love; it is as it were love's second name and, at the same time, the specific manner in which love is revealed and effected vis-a-vis the reality of the evil that is in the world, affecting and besieging man, insinuating itself even into his heart and capable of causing him to \"perish in Gehenna\" (Mt 10:28) (7).</p><p><em>3. Mercy as </em>Hesed<em> and </em>Rahamim<em>.</em></p><p> In describing mercy, the books of the Old Testament use two expressions in particular, each having a different semantic nuance. First there is the term <em>hesed</em>, which indicates a profound attitude of \"goodness.\" When this is established between two individuals, they do not just wish each other well; they are also faithful to each other by virtue of an interior commitment, and therefore also by virtue of a faithfulness to themselves. Since <em>hesed</em> also means \"grace\" or \"love,\" this occurs precisely on the basis of this fidelity. The fact that the commitment in question has not only a moral character but almost a juridical one makes no difference. When in the Old Testament the word <em>hesed</em> is used of the Lord, this always occurs in connection with the covenant that God established with Israel. This covenant was, on God's part, a gift and a grace for Israel. Nevertheless, since, in harmony with the covenant entered into, God had made a commitment to respect it, <em>hesed</em> also acquired in a certain sense a legal content. The juridical commitment on God's part ceased to oblige whenever Israel broke the covenant and did not respect its conditions. But precisely at this point, <em>hesed</em>, in ceasing to be a juridical obligation, revealed its deeper aspect: it showed itself as what it was at the beginning, that is, as love that gives, love more powerful than betrayal, grace stronger than sin.</p><p>This fidelity vis-a-vis the unfaithful \"daughter of my people\" (cf. Lam. 4:3, 6) is, in brief, on God's part, fidelity to Himself. This becomes obvious in the frequent recurrence together of the two terms <em>hesed</em> we've met (= grace and fidelity), which could be considered a case of hendiadys (cf. e.g. Ex. 34:6; 2 Sm. 2:6; 15:20; Ps. 25[24]:10; 40[39]:11-12; 85[84]:11; 138[137]:2; Mi. 7:20). \"It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name\" (Ez. 36:22). Therefore Israel, although burdened with guilt for having broken the covenant, cannot lay claim to God's <em>hesed</em> on the basis of (legal) justice; yet it can and must go on hoping and trusting to obtain it, since the God of the covenant is really \"responsible for his love.\" The fruits of this love are forgiveness and restoration to grace, the reestablishment of the interior covenant.</p><p>The second word which in the terminology of the Old Testament serves to define mercy is <em>rahamim</em>. This has a different nuance from that of <em>hesed</em>. While <em>hesed</em> highlights the marks of fidelity to self and of \"responsibility for one's own love\" (which are in a certain sense masculine characteristics), <em>rahamim</em>, in its very root, denotes the love of a mother (<em>rehem</em> = mother's womb). From the deep and original bond, indeed the unity, that links a mother to her child there springs a particular relationship to the child, a particular love. Of this love one can say that it is completely gratuitous, not merited, and that in this aspect it constitutes an interior necessity: an exigency of the heart. It is, as it were, a \"feminine\" variation of the masculine fidelity to self expressed by hesed. Against this psychological background, <em>rahamim</em> generates a whole range of feelings, including goodness and tenderness, patience and understanding, that is, readiness to forgive.</p><p>The Old Testament attributes to the Lord precisely these characteristics when it uses the term <em>rahamim</em> in speaking of Him. We read in Isaiah: \"Can a woman forget her suckling child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you\" (Is. 49:15). This love, faithful and invincible thanks to the mysterious power of motherhood, is expressed in the Old Testament texts in various ways: as salvation from dangers, especially from enemies; also as forgiveness of sins-of individuals and also of the whole of Israel; and finally in readiness to fulfill the (eschatological) promise and hope, in spite of human infidelity, as we read in Hosea: \"I will heal their faithlessness, I will love them freely\" (Hos. 14:5).</p>"

                description: "<p><strong>Top Ten \"Mercy Quotes\" from Pope Benedict XVI</strong></p><p>1. At this time, side by side in my heart, I feel two contrasting emotions. On the one hand, a sense of inadequacy and human apprehension as I face the responsibility for the universal Church, entrusted to me yesterday as Successor of the Apostle Peter in this See of Rome. On the other, I have a lively feeling of profound gratitude to God who, as the liturgy makes us sing, never leaves his flock untended but leads it down the ages under the guidance of those whom he himself has chosen as the Vicars of his Son and has made shepherds of the flock (cf. Preface of Apostles I).</p><p>Dear friends, this deep gratitude for a gift of Divine Mercy is uppermost in my heart in spite of all. And I consider it a special grace which my Venerable Predecessor, John Paul II, has obtained for me. I seem to feel his strong hand clasping mine; I seem to see his smiling eyes and hear his words, at this moment addressed specifically to me, \"Do not be afraid!\"</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— First message as Pope, April 20, 2005. </p><p>2. The Servant of God John Paul II wanted the Sunday after Easter to be dedicated in a special way to divine mercy, and providence disposed that he should die precisely on the vigil of that day (in the hands of Divine Mercy).</p><p>The mystery of the merciful love of God was at the center of the pontificate of my venerated predecessor. Let us recall, in particular, the encyclical \"Dives in Misericordia\" of 1980, and the dedication of the new shrine of Divine Mercy in Krakow, in 2002.</p><p>The words he pronounced on that last occasion were as a synthesis of his magisterium, evidencing that devotion to Divine Mercy is not a secondary devotion, but an integral dimension of a Christian's faith and prayer.</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— <em>Regina Caeli</em> Address for Divine Mercy Sunday on April 23, 2006.</p><p>3. On this occasion we encounter two mysteries: the mystery of human suffering and the mystery of Divine Mercy. At first sight these two mysteries seem to be opposed to one another. But when we study them more deeply in the light of faith, we find that they are placed in reciprocal harmony through the mystery of the Cross of Christ. As Saint John Paul II said in this place: \"The Cross is the most profound bowing down of the Divinity towards man, the Cross is like a touch of eternal love on the most painful wounds of humanity's earthly existence\" (August 17, 2002). Dear friends who are sick, who are marked by suffering in body or soul, you are most closely united to the Cross of Christ, and at the same time, you are the most eloquent witnesses of God's mercy. Through you and through your suffering, he bows down toward humanity with love. You who say in silence: \"Jesus, I trust in you\" teach us that there is no faith more profound, no hope more alive and no love more ardent than the faith, hope and love of a person who in the midst of suffering places himself securely in God's hands.</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Address to the Sick at the Shrine of Divine Mercy in Krakow-Lagiewniki on May 27, 2006.</p><p>4. [Being] at the Shrine of Divine Mercy in Lagiewniki allowed me to emphasize that only Divine Mercy illuminates the mystery of man. In the convent near this shrine, on contemplating the luminous wounds of the risen Christ, Sister Faustina Kowalska received a message of confidence for humanity, the message of Divine Mercy, which John Paul II echoed and of which he became the interpreter. It is a really central message for our time: Mercy as the force of God, as the divine limit against the evil of the world.</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— General Audience on May 31, 2006 following his pilgrimage to Poland where he visited the Shrine of Divine Mercy in Krakow-Lagiewniki.</p><p>5. [A man has just been robbed and beaten, and he is lying by the side of the road. A priest and a Levite pass by on the other side of the road. Will anyone stop to help? Pope Benedict picks up the narrative here.]</p><p>And now the Samaritan enters the stage. What will he do? [Unlike the expert in the Law who had just been questioning Jesus] he does not ask how far his obligations of solidarity extend. Nor does he ask about the merits required for eternal life. Something else happens: His heart is wrenched open. The Gospel uses the word that in Hebrew had originally referred to the mother's womb and maternal care. Seeing this man in such a state is a blow that strikes him \"viscerally,\" touching his soul. \"He had compassion\", that is how we translate the text today, diminishing its original vitality. Struck in his soul by the lightning flash of mercy, he himself now becomes a neighbor, heedless of any question or danger. The burden of the question thus shifts here. The issue is no longer which other person is a neighbor to me or not. The question is about me. I have to become the neighbor, and when I do, the other person counts for me \"as myself.\"</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Excerpt from the book <em>Jesus of Nazareth</em>, Doubleday, 2007, p. 197.</p><p>6. The Lord took His wounds with Him to eternity. He is a wounded God; He let Himself be injured through His love for us. His wounds are a sign that He understands and allows Himself to be wounded out of love for us. These wounds of His: how tangible they are to us in the history of our time! Indeed, time and again, he allows Himself to be wounded for our sake. What certainty of His mercy, what consolation do His wounds mean for us! And what a duty they are for us, the duty to allow ourselves in turn to be wounded for Him!</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Homily on Divine Mercy Sunday, April 15, 2007.</p><p>7. In our time, humanity needs a strong proclamation and witness of God's mercy. Beloved John Paul II, a great apostle of Divine Mercy, prophetically intuited this urgent pastoral need. He dedicated his second Encyclical to it and throughout his Pontificate made himself the missionary of God's love to all peoples.</p><p>After the tragic events of September 11, 2001, which darkened the dawn of the third millennium, he invited Christians and people of good will to believe that God's mercy is stronger than all evil, and that only in the Cross of Christ is the world's salvation found.</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— <em>Angelus </em>message on September 16, 2007.</p><p>8. Indeed, mercy is the central nucleus of the Gospel message; it is the very name of God, the Face with which he revealed himself in the Old Covenant and fully in Jesus Christ, the incarnation of creative and redemptive Love. May this merciful love also shine on the face of the Church and show itself through the sacraments, in particular that of Reconciliation, and in works of charity, both communitarian and individual. May all that the Church says and does manifest the mercy God feels for man, and therefore for us. When the Church has to recall an unrecognized truth or a betrayed good, she always does so impelled by merciful love, so that men and women may have life and have it abundantly (cf. Jn 10:10). From Divine Mercy, which brings peace to hearts, genuine peace flows into the world, peace between different peoples, cultures and religions.</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— <em>Regina Caeli</em> message on Divine Mercy Sunday, March 30, 2008.</p><p>9. God's mercy, as [Saint John Paul II] himself said, is a privileged key to the interpretation of his Pontificate. He wanted the message of God's merciful love to be made known to all and urged the faithful to witness to it (cf. Homily at Krakow-Lagiewniki, August 17, 2002). This is why he raised to the honor of the altars Sr. Faustina Kowalska, a humble Sister who, through a mysterious divine plan, became a prophetic messenger of Divine Mercy. The Servant of God John Paul II had known and personally experienced the terrible tragedies of the 20th century and for a long time wondered what could stem the tide of evil. The answer could only be found in God's love. In fact, only Divine Mercy is able to impose limitations on evil; only the almighty love of God can defeat the tyranny of the wicked and the destructive power of selfishness and hate. For this reason, during his last visit to Poland, he said on his return to the land of his birth: \"Apart from the mercy of God there is no other source of hope for mankind\" (Homily at Krakow-Lagiewniki, August 17, 2002).</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Homily on the third anniversary of the death of Saint John Paul II, April 2, 2008. </p><p>10. Yes, dear friends, the first World Congress on Divine Mercy ended this morning with the Eucharistic Celebration in St. Peter's Basilica.

I think we too are the people who, on the one hand, want to listen to Jesus, but on the other hand, at times, like to find a stick to beat others with, to condemn others. And Jesus has this message for us: mercy. I think — and I say it with humility — that this is the Lord's most powerful message: mercy.</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Homily on March 17, 2013.</p><p>2. It is not easy to entrust oneself to God's mercy, because it is an abyss beyond our comprehension. But we must! ... \"Oh, I am a great sinner!\" \"All the better! Go to Jesus: He likes you to tell him these things!\" He forgets, He has a very special capacity for forgetting. He forgets, He kisses you, He embraces you and He simply says to you: \"Neither do I condemn you; go, and sin no more\" (Jn 8:11). </p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Homily on March 17, 2013.</p><p>3. God's mercy can make even the driest land become a garden, can restore life to dry bones (cf. Ez 37:1-14). ...

Let us ... remember Peter: three times he denied Jesus, precisely when he should have been closest to him; and when he hits bottom he meets the gaze of Jesus who patiently, wordlessly, says to him: \"Peter, don't be afraid of your weakness, trust in Me.\" Peter understands, he feels the loving gaze of Jesus and he weeps.

Let us trust in His mercy!</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Regina Caeli on Divine Mercy Sunday, April 7, 2013.</p><p>6. Many question in their hearts: why a Jubilee of Mercy today? Simply because the Church, in this time of great historical change, is called to offer more evident signs of God’s presence and closeness. This is not the time to be distracted; on the contrary, we need to be vigilant and to reawaken in ourselves the capacity to see what is essential. This is a time for the Church to rediscover the meaning of the mission entrusted to her by the Lord on the day of Easter: to be a sign and an instrument of the Father’s mercy (cf. Jn 20:21-23).</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Homily at Vespers before Divine Mercy Sunday, April 11, 2015.</p><p>7. In the redeeming contact with the wounds of the Risen One, Thomas showed his own wounds, his own injuries, his own lacerations, his own humiliation; in the print of the nails he found the decisive proof that he was loved, that he was expected, that he was understood. He found himself before the Messiah filled with kindness, mercy, tenderness. This was the Lord he was searching for, he, in the hidden depths of his being, for he had always known He was like this. And how many of us are searching deep in our heart to meet Jesus, just as He is: kind, merciful, tender! For we know, deep down, that He is like this. Having rediscovered personal contact with Christ who is amiable and mercifully patient, Thomas understood the profound significance of his Resurrection and, intimately transformed, he declared his full and total faith in Him exclaiming: “My Lord and my God!” (v. 28).</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Regina Caeli on Divine Mercy Sunday, April 12, 2015.</p><p>8. St Paul reminds us: “God, who is rich in mercy”, — never forget that He is rich in mercy — “out of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ” (Eph 2:4). The Cross of Christ is the supreme proof of the mercy and love that God has for us: Jesus loved us “to the end” (Jn 13:1), meaning not only to the last instant of his earthly life, but to the farthest limit of love. While in creation the Father gave us proof of his immense love by giving us life, in the passion and death of his Son He gave us the proof of proofs: He came to suffer and die for us. So great is God’s mercy: He loves us, He forgives us; God forgives all and God forgives always.</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\">— Angelus on March 15, 2015.</p><p>9. Jesus Christ is the face of the Father’s mercy. These words might well sum up the mystery of the Christian faith.

We need constantly to contemplate the mystery of mercy. It is a wellspring of joy, serenity, and peace. Our salvation depends on it. Mercy: the word reveals the very mystery of the Most Holy Trinity. Mercy: the ultimate and supreme act by which God comes to meet us. Mercy: the fundamental law that dwells in the heart of every person who looks sincerely into the eyes of his brothers and sisters on the path of life.

                description: "<p>In the evening, when I was in my cell, I saw an Angel, the executor of divine wrath. He was clothed in a dazzling robe, his face gloriously bright, a cloud beneath his feet. From the cloud, bolts of thunder and flashes of lightning were springing into his hands; and from his hand they were going forth, and only then were they striking the earth. When I saw this sign of divine wrath which was about to strike the earth, and in particular a certain place, which for good reasons I cannot name, I began to implore the Angel to hold off for a few moments, and the world would do penance. But my plea was a mere nothing in the face of the divine anger. Just then I saw the Most Holy Trinity. The greatness of Its majesty pierced me deeply, and I did not dare to repeat my entreaties. At that very moment I felt in my soul the power of Jesus' grace, which dwells in my soul. When I became conscious of this grace, I was instantly snatched up before the Throne of God. Oh, how great is our Lord and God and how incomprehensible His holiness! I will make no attempt to describe this greatness, because before long we shall all see Him as He is. I found myself pleading with God for the world with words heard interiorly.</p><p> As I was praying in this manner, I saw the Angel's helplessness: he could not carry out the just punishment which was rightly due for sins. Never before had I prayed with such inner power as I did then.</p><p> The words with which I entreated God are these: <strong>Eternal Father, I offer You the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your dearly beloved Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ for our sins and those of the whole world; for the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us.</strong></p><p> The next morning, when I entered chapel, I heard these words interiorly: <strong>Every time you enter the chapel, immediately recite the prayer which I taught you yesterday.</strong> When I had said the prayer, in my soul I heard these words: <strong>This prayer will serve to appease My wrath. You will recite it for nine days, on the beads of the rosary, in the following manner: First of all, you will say one OUR FATHER and HAIL MARY and the I BELIEVE IN GOD. Then on the OUR FATHER beads you will say the following words: \"Eternal Father, I offer You the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your dearly beloved Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world.\" On the HAIL MARY beads you will say the following words: \"For the sake of His sorrowful Passion have mercy on us and on the whole world.\" In conclusion, three times you will recite these words: \"Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world\"</strong> (474-476).</p><p><strong>Say unceasingly the chaplet that I have taught you. Whoever will recite it will receive great mercy at the hour of death. Priests will recommend it to sinners as their last hope of salvation. Even if there were a sinner most hardened, if he were to recite this chaplet only once, he would receive grace from My infinite mercy</strong> (687).</p><p><strong>The souls that say this chaplet will be embraced by My mercy during their lifetime and especially at the hour of their death </strong>(754).</p><p>The following afternoon, when I entered the ward, I saw someone dying, and learned that the agony had started during the night. &hellip; [T]hen, I heard a voice in my soul: <strong>Say the chaplet which I taught you.</strong> I ran to fetch my rosary and knelt down by the dying person and, with all the ardor of my soul, I began to say the chaplet. Suddenly the dying person opened her eyes and looked at me; I had not managed to finish the entire chaplet when she died, with extraordinary peace. I fervently asked the Lord to fulfill the promise He had given me for the recitation of the chaplet. The Lord gave me to know that the soul had been granted the grace He had promised me. That was the first soul to receive the benefit of the Lord's promise. I could feel the power of mercy envelop that soul.</p><p>When I entered my solitude, I heard these words:<strong> At the hour of their death, I defend as My own glory every soul that will say this chaplet; or when others say it for a dying person, the pardon is the same. When this chaplet is said by the bedside of a dying person, God's anger is placated, unfathomable mercy envelops the soul, and the very depths of My tender mercy are moved for the sake of the sorrowful Passion of My Son </strong>(810).</p><p><strong>Oh, what great graces I will grant to souls who say this chaplet; the very depths of My tender mercy are stirred for the sake of those who say the chaplet </strong>(848).</p><p>\"Jesus, I have so much to tell You.\" And the Lord said to me with great love, <strong>Speak, My daughter</strong>. And I started to enumerate the pains of my heart; that is, how greatly concerned I am for all mankind, that \"they all do not know You, and those who do know You do not love You as You deserve to be loved. I also see how terribly sinners offend You; and then again, I see how severely the faithful, especially Your servants, are oppressed and persecuted. And then, too, I see many souls rushing headlong into the terrible abyss of hell. You see, Jesus, this is the pain that gnaws at my heart and bones. And, although You show me special love and inundate my heart with streams of Your joys, nevertheless, this does not appease the sufferings I have just mentioned, but rather they penetrate my poor heart all the more acutely. Oh, how ardently I desire that all mankind turn with trust to Your mercy. Then, seeing the glory of Your name, my heart will be comforted.\"</p><p>Jesus listened to these outpourings of my heart with gravity and interest, as if He had known nothing about them, and this seemed to make it easier for me to talk. And the Lord said to me, <strong>My daughter, those words of your heart are pleasing to Me, and by saying the chaplet you are bringing humankind closer to Me</strong> (929).</p><p>The heat is so intense today that it is difficult to bear. We are all thirsting for rain, and still it does not come. For several days the sky has been overcast, but there is no rain. When I looked at the plants, thirsting for the rain I was moved with pity, and I decided to say the chaplet until the Lord would send us rain. Before supper, the sky covered over with clouds, and a heavy rain fell on the earth. I had been saying this prayer without interruption for three hours. And the Lord let me know that everything can be obtained by means of this prayer (1128).</p><p><strong>My daughter, encourage souls to say the chaplet which I have given to you. It pleases Me to grant everything they ask of Me by saying the chaplet. When hardened sinners say it, I will fill their souls with peace, and the hour of their death will be a happy one </strong>(1541).</p><p><strong>Write that when they say this chaplet in the presence of the dying, I will stand between My Father and the dying person, not as the just Judge but as the merciful Savior</strong> (1541).</p><p><strong>My daughter, help Me to save a certain dying sinner. Say the chaplet that I have taught you for him.</strong> When I began to say the chaplet, I saw the man dying in the midst of terrible torment and struggle. His Guardian Angel was defending him, but he was, as it were, powerless against the enormity of the soul's misery. A multitude of devils was waiting for the soul. But while I was saying the chaplet, I saw Jesus just as He is depicted in the image. The rays which issued from Jesus' Heart enveloped the sick man, and the powers of darkness fled in panic. The sick man peacefully breathed his last. When I came to myself, I understood how very important the chaplet was for the dying. It appeases the anger of God (1565).</p><p>Today I was awakened by a great storm. The wind was raging, and it was raining in torrents, thunderbolts striking again and again. I began to pray that the storm would do no harm, when I heard the words: <strong>Say the chaplet I have taught you, and the storm will cease.</strong> I began immediately to say the chaplet and hadn't even finished it when the storm suddenly ceased, and I heard the words: Through the chaplet you will obtain everything, if what you ask for is compatible with My will (1731).</p><p>When a great storm was approaching, I began to say the chaplet. Suddenly I heard the voice of an angel: \"I cannot approach in this storm, because the light which comes from her mouth drives back both me and the storm.\" Such was the angel's complaint to God. I then recognized how much havoc he was to have made through this storm; but I also recognized that this prayer was pleasing to God, and that this chaplet was most powerful (1791).</p><p>Today, the Lord came to me and said, <strong>My daughter, help Me to save souls. You will go to a dying sinner, and you will continue to recite the chaplet, and in this way you will obtain for him trust in My mercy, for he is already in despair.</strong></p><p>Suddenly, I found myself in a strange cottage where an elderly man was dying amidst great torments. All about the bed was a multitude of demons and the family, who were crying. When I began to pray, the spirits of darkness fled, with hissing and threats directed at me. The soul became calm and, filled with trust, rested in the Lord.</p><p>At the same moment, I found myself again in my own room. How this happens &hellip; I do not know (1797-1798). </p>"

When you approach the confessional, know this, that I Myself am waiting there for you. I am only hidden by the priest, but I myself act in your soul.

God's mercy sometimes touches the sinner at the last moment in a wondrous and mysterious way. Outwardly, it seems as if everything were lost, but it is not so. The soul, illumined by a ray of God's powerful final grace, turns to God in the last moment with such a power of love that, in an instant, it receives from God forgiveness of sin and punishment, while outwardly it shows no sign either of repentance or of contrition, because souls [at that stage] no longer react to external things. Oh, how beyond comprehension is God's mercy! But &mdash; horror! &mdash; there are also souls who voluntarily and consciously reject and scorn this grace! Although a person is at the point of death, the merciful God gives the soul that interior vivid moment, so that if the soul is willing, it has the possibility of returning to God. But sometimes, the obduracy in souls is so great that consciously they choose hell; they [thus] make useless all the prayers that other souls offer to God for them and even the efforts of God Himself (1698).</p><p><em>GOD'S INFINITE GOODNESS IN CREATING MANKIND</em>. God, who in Your mercy have deigned to call man from nothingness into being, generously have You bestowed upon him nature and grace. But that seemed too little for Your infinite goodness. In Your mercy, O Lord, You have given us everlasting life. You admit us to Your everlasting happiness and grant us to share in Your interior life. And You do this solely out of Your mercy. You bestow on us the gift of Your grace, only because You are good and full of love. You had no need of us at all to be happy, but You, O Lord, want to share Your own happiness with us. But man did not stand the test. You could have punished him, like the angels, with eternal rejection, but here Your mercy appeared, and the very depths of Your being were moved with great compassion, and You promised to restore our salvation. It is an incomprehensible abyss of Your compassion that You did not punish us as we deserved. May Your mercy be glorified, O Lord; we will praise it for endless ages. And the angels were amazed at the greatness of the mercy which You have shown for mankind ... (1743).</p><p><em>THE INFINITE GOODNESS OF GOD IN SENDING US HIS ONLYBEGOTTEN SON</em>. God, You did not destroy man after his fall, but in Your mercy You forgave him, You forgave in a divine way; that is, not only have You absolved him from guilt, but You have bestowed upon him every grace. Mercy has moved You to deign to descend among us and lift us up from our misery. God will descend to earth; the Immortal Lord of lords will abase Himself. &hellip; [T]he inconceivable miracle of Your mercy takes place, O Lord. The Word becomes flesh; God dwells among us, the Word of God, Mercy Incarnate. By Your descent, You have lifted us up to Your divinity. Such is the excess of Your love, the abyss of Your mercy. Heaven is amazed at the superabundance of Your love. No one fears to approach You now. You are the God of mercy. You have compassion on misery. You are our God, and we are Your people. You are our Father, and we are Your children by grace. Praise be to Your mercy, that You have deigned to descend among us (1745).</p><p>Heaven is astounded that God has become man &hellip; .<br /> Why is it that You do not unite Yourself with a Seraph, but with a sinner, O Lord?<br /> Oh, because, despite the purity of the virginal womb, this is a mystery of Your mercy.<br /> O mystery of God's mercy, O God of compassion,<br /> That You have deigned to leave the heavenly throne<br /> And to stoop down to our misery, to human weakness,<br /> For it is not the angels, but man who needs mercy (1746).</p><p><em>GOD'S INFINITE GOODNESS IN REDEEMING MAN</em>. God, You could have saved thousands of worlds with one word; a single sigh from Jesus would have satisfied Your justice. But You Yourself, Jesus, purely out of love for us, underwent such a terrible Passion. Your Father's justice would have been propitiated with a single sigh from You, and all Your self-abasement is solely the work of Your mercy and Your inconceivable love. On leaving the earth, O Lord, You wanted to stay with us, and so You left us Yourself in the Sacrament of the Altar, and You opened wide Your mercy to us. There is no misery that could exhaust You; You have called us all to this fountain of love, to this spring of God's compassion. Here is the tabernacle of Your mercy, here is the remedy for all our ills. To You, O living spring of mercy, all souls are drawn; some like deer, thirsting for Your love, others to wash the wound of their sins, and still others, exhausted by life, to draw strength. At the moment of Your death on the Cross, You bestowed upon us eternal life; allowing Your most holy side to be opened, You opened an inexhaustible spring of mercy for us, giving us Your dearest possession, the Blood and Water from Your Heart. Such is the omnipotence of Your mercy. From it all grace flows to us (1747).</p><p><em>GOD'S INFINITE GOODNESS IN ADORNING THE WHOLE WORLD WITH BEAUTY IN ORDER TO MAKE MAN'S STAY ON EARTH PLEASANT.</em> O God, how generously Your mercy is spread everywhere, and You have done all this for man. Oh, how much You must love him, since Your love is so active on his behalf. O my Creator and Lord, I see on all sides the trace of our hand and the seal of Your mercy, which embraces all created things. O my most compassionate Creator, I want to give You worship on behalf of all creatures and all inanimate creation; I call on the whole universe to glorify Your mercy. Oh, how great is Your goodness, O God! (1749).</p><p><strong>Before I made the world, I loved you with the love your heart is experiencing today and, throughout the centuries, My love will never change</strong> (1754).</p>"

There are moments when one should be silent, and when it would be inappropriate to talk with creatures; these are the moments when one is dissatisfied with oneself, and when the soul feels as weak as a little child.

Suddenly, my soul was thrown into great interior darkness. My soul was filled with bitterness instead of joy, and my heart was pierced with a sharp pain. I felt so miserable and unworthy of this grace and, conscious of my misery and unworthiness, I would not have dared to so much as approach the feet of the youngest postulant to kiss them. I saw the postulants, in spirit, beautiful and pleasing to the Lord; and myself, an abyss of misery. After the conference, I flung myself at the feet of the hidden God, midst tears and pain.

In that same moment I nestled close to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus with so much trust that even if I had the sins of all the damned weighing on my conscience, I would not have doubted God's mercy but, with a heart crushed to dust, I would have thrown myself into the abyss of Your mercy. I believe, O Jesus, that You would not reject me, but would absolve me through the hand of Your representative (1318).</p><p>With one eye, I gaze on the abyss of my misery and with the other, on the abyss of Your mercy (1345).</p><p>This great misery of mine does not deprive me of trust.

I am an abyss of wretchedness, I am nothingness itself; so what will be so strange if You leave me alone and I fall? I am an infant, Lord, so I cannot get along by myself. However, beyond all abandonment I trust, and in spite of my own feeling I trust, and I am being completely transformed into trust &mdash; often in spite of what I feel (1489).</p><p>O Greatly Merciful God, Infinite Goodness, today all mankind calls out from the abyss of its misery to Your mercy &mdash; to Your compassion, O God; and it is with its mighty voice of misery that it cries out.

O my God, how good You are, how great is Your mercy! You visit me with so many graces, me who am a most wretched speck of dust. Prostrating myself at Your feet, O Lord, I confess with a sincere heart that I have done nothing to deserve even the least of Your graces. It is in Your infinite goodness that You give Yourself to me so generously. Therefore, the greater the graces which my heart receives, the deeper it plunges itself in humility (1661).</p><p>Your mercy abolishes the chasm which separates the Creator from the creature (1692).</p><p><strong>I am mercy itself; therefore I ask you to offer Me your misery and this very helplessness of yours and, in this way, you will delight My Heart </strong>(1775).</p><p>One day during Holy Mass, the Lord gave me a deeper knowledge of His holiness and His majesty, and at the same time I saw my own misery. This knowledge made me happy, and my soul drowned itself completely in His mercy. I felt enormously happy (1801).</p><p>Although I am such misery, I do not fear You, because I know Your mercy well. Nothing will frighten me away from You, O God, because everything is so much less than what I know [Your mercy to be] &mdash; I see that clearly (1803).</p><p>When I received Jesus [in Holy Communion], I threw myself into Him as into an abyss of unfathomable mercy. And the more I felt I was misery itself, the stronger grew my trust in Him. In this abasement, I passed the whole day (1817).</p><p>Today, my soul is preparing for Holy Communion as for a wedding feast, wherein all the participants are resplendent with unspeakable beauty. And I, too, have been invited to this banquet, but I do not see that beauty within myself, only an abyss of misery. And, although I do not feel worthy of sitting down to table, I will however slip under the table, at the feet of Jesus, and will beg for the crumbs that fall from the table. Knowing Your mercy, I therefore approach You, Jesus, for sooner will I run out of misery than will the compassion of Your Heart exhaust itself. That is why during this day I will keep arousing trust in The Divine Mercy (1827).</p>"

Encourage souls to place great trust in My fathomless mercy. Let the weak, sinful soul have no fear to approach Me, for even if it had more sins than there are grains of sand in the world, all would be drowned in the unmeasurable depths of My mercy</strong> (1059).</p><p>[Let] <strong>the greatest sinners place their trust in My mercy. They have the right before others to trust in the abyss of My mercy. My daughter, write about My mercy towards tormented souls. Souls that make an appeal to My mercy delight Me. To such souls I grant even more graces than they ask. I cannot punish even the greatest sinner if he makes an appeal to My compassion, but on the contrary, I justify him in My unfathomable and inscrutable mercy. Write: before I come as a just Judge, I first open wide the door of My mercy. He who refuses to pass through the door of My mercy must pass through the door of My justice </strong>(1146).</p><p><strong>My daughter, write that the greater the misery of a soul, the greater its right to My mercy; [urge] all souls to trust in the unfathomable abyss of My mercy, because I want to save them all.

Tell sinful souls not to be afraid to approach Me; speak to them of My great mercy</strong> (1396).</p><p><strong>Be not afraid of your Savior, O sinful soul. I make the first move to come to you, for I know that by yourself you are unable to lift yourself to Me.

Come, then, with trust to draw graces from this fountain. I never reject a contrite heart. Your misery has disappeared in the depths of My mercy. Do not argue with Me about your wretchedness. You will give Me pleasure if you hand over to Me all your troubles and griefs. I shall heap upon you the treasures of My grace</strong> (1485).</p><p><strong>O soul steeped in darkness, do not despair. All is not yet lost.

Because you are weak, I take you in My arms and carry you to the home of My Father</strong> (1486).</p><p><strong>Do not lose heart in coming for pardon, for I am always ready to forgive you</strong> (1488).</p><p>All grace flows from mercy, and the last hour abounds with mercy for us. Let no one doubt concerning the goodness of God; even if a person's sins were as dark as night, God's mercy is stronger than our misery. One thing alone is necessary: that the sinner set ajar the door of his heart, be it ever so little, to let in a ray of God's merciful grace, and then God will do the rest. But poor is the soul who has shut the door on God's mercy, even at the last hour. It was just such souls who plunged Jesus into deadly sorrow in the Garden of Olives (1507).</p><p><strong>Write this for the benefit of distressed souls: when a soul sees and realizes the gravity of its sins, when the whole abyss of the misery into which it immersed itself is displayed before its eyes, let it not despair, but with trust let it throw itself into the arms of My mercy, as a child into the arms of its beloved mother. These souls have a right of priority to My compassionate Heart, they have first access to My mercy. Tell them that no soul that has called upon My mercy has been disappointed or brought to shame. I delight particularly in a soul which has placed its trust in My goodness</strong> (1541).</p><p>Even if I had had the sins of the whole world, as well as the sins of all the condemned souls weighing on my conscience, I would not have doubted God's goodness but, without hesitation, would have thrown myself into the abyss of the divine mercy, which is always open to us; and, with a heart crushed to dust, I would have cast myself at His feet, abandoning myself totally to His holy will, which is mercy itself (1552).</p><p>O soul, whoever you may be in this world,<br />Even if your sins were as black as night,<br />Do not fear God, weak child that you are,<br />For great is the power of God's mercy (1652).</p><p><strong>You see My mercy for sinners, which at this moment is revealing itself in all its power. See how little you have written about it; it is only a single drop. Do what is in your power, so that sinners may come to know My goodness</strong> (1665).</p><p><strong>There are souls who thwart My efforts, but I have not given up on them; as often as they turn to Me, I hurry to their aid, shielding them with My mercy, and I give them the first place in My compassionate Heart</strong> (1682).</p><p><strong>Write: I am Thrice Holy, and I detest the smallest sin. I cannot love a soul which is stained with sin; but when it repents, there is no limit to My generosity toward it. My mercy embraces and justifies it.

I forget the bitterness with which they fed My Heart and rejoice at their return.</strong></p><p><strong>Tell sinners that no one shall escape My Hand; if they run away from My Merciful Heart, they will fall into My Just Hands.

And if they bring all My graces to naught, I begin to be angry with them, leaving them alone and giving them what they want</strong> (1728).</p><p>O God of compassion, You alone can justify me, and You will never reject me when I, contrite, approach Your Merciful Heart, where no one has ever been refused, even if he were the greatest sinner (1730).</p><p><strong>Write, My daughter, that I am mercy itself for the contrite soul.

It finds all things important, it highly appreciates all things, it thanks God for all things, it draws profit for the soul from all things, and it gives all glory to God. It places its trust in God (148).</p><p>I went across the garden one afternoon and stopped on the shore of the lake; I stood there for a long time, contemplating my surroundings. Suddenly, I saw the Lord Jesus near me, and He graciously said to me, <strong>All this I created for you &hellip; and know that all this beauty is nothing compared to what I have prepared for you for in eternity</strong> (158).</p><p>I want to be completely transformed into Your mercy and to be Your living reflection, O Lord. May the greatest of all divine attributes, that of Your unfathomable mercy, pass through my heart and soul to my neighbor.</p><p>Help me, O Lord, that my eyes may be merciful, so that I may never suspect or judge from appearances, but look for what is beautiful in my neighbors' souls and come to their rescue.</p><p>Help me, that my ears may be merciful, so that I may give heed to my neighbors' needs and not be indifferent to their pains and moanings.</p><p>Help me, O Lord, that my tongue may be merciful, so that I should never speak negatively of my neighbor, but have a word of comfort and forgiveness for all.</p><p>Help me, O Lord, that my hands may be merciful and filled with good deeds, so that I may do only good to my neighbors and take upon myself the more difficult and toilsome tasks.</p><p>Help me, that my feet may be merciful, so that I may hurry to assist my neighbor, overcoming my own fatigue and weariness. My true rest is in the service of my neighbor.</p><p>Help me, O Lord, that my heart may be merciful so that I myself may feel all the sufferings of my neighbor. I will refuse my heart to no one. I will be sincere even with those who, I know, will abuse my kindness. And I will lock myself up in the most merciful Heart of Jesus. I will bear my own suffering in silence. May Your mercy, O Lord, rest upon me (163).</p><p>You Yourself command me to exercise the three degrees of mercy. The first: the act of mercy, of whatever kind. The second: the word of mercy &mdash; if I cannot carry out a work of mercy, I will assist by my words. The third: prayer &mdash; if I cannot show mercy by deeds or words, I can always do so by prayer. My prayer reaches out even there where I cannot reach out physically (163).</p><p><strong>My daughter, I desire that your heart be formed after the model of My merciful Heart. You must be completely imbued with My mercy</strong> (167).</p><p>The soul must divert the stream of its love, but not into the mud or into a vacuum, but into God. How I rejoice when I reflect on this, for I feel clearly that He Himself is in my heart. Just Jesus alone! I love creatures insofar as they help me to become united to God. I love people because I see the image of God in them (373).</p><p>I received an inner understanding of the great reward that God is preparing for us, not only for our good deeds, but also for our sincere desire to perform them. What a great grace of God this is! (450).</p><p>One must first live in You in order to recognize You in others (503).</p><p>When I see someone else's good, I rejoice as if it were mine. The joy of others is my joy, and the suffering of others is my suffering (633).</p><p>Everything I look at speaks to me of God's mercy (651).</p><p>I ask You to make my heart so big that there will be room in it for the needs of all the souls living on the face of the earth &hellip; . O Jesus, make my heart sensitive to all the sufferings of my neighbor, whether of body or of soul. O my Jesus, I know that You act toward us as we act toward our neighbor.</p><p>My Jesus, make my heart like unto Your merciful Heart. Jesus, help me to go through life doing good to everyone (692).</p><p>I understood that it is not possible for a person to act in the same manner towards everyone &hellip; . Your love, Jesus, gives the soul this great prudence in its dealings with others (695).</p><p><strong>My daughter, if I demand through you that people revere My mercy, you should be the first to distinguish yourself by this confidence in My mercy.

You must not shrink from this or try to excuse or absolve yourself from it.</strong></p><p><strong>I am giving you three ways of exercising mercy toward your neighbor: the first &mdash; by deed, the second &mdash; by word, the third &mdash; by prayer. In these three degrees is contained the fullness of mercy, and it is an unquestionable proof of love for Me. By this means a soul glorifies and pays reverence to My mercy. Yes, the first Sunday after Easter is the Feast of Mercy, but there must also be acts of mercy, and I demand the worship of My mercy through the solemn celebration of the Feast and through the veneration of the image which is painted. By means of this image I shall grant many graces to souls. It is to be a reminder of the demands of My mercy, because even the strongest faith is of no avail without works.</strong> O my Jesus, You Yourself must help me in everything, because You see how very little I am, and so I depend solely on Your goodness, O God (742).</p><p>I shall fight all evil with the weapon of mercy (745).</p><p>O my Jesus, teach me to open the bosom of mercy and love to everyone who asks for it. Jesus &hellip; teach me so that all my prayers and deeds may bear the seal of Your mercy (755).</p><p>O my Jesus, you know what efforts are needed to live sincerely and unaffectedly with those from whom our nature flees, or with those who, deliberately or not, have made us suffer. Humanly speaking, this is impossible. At such times more than at others, I try to discover the Lord Jesus in such a person and for this same Jesus, I do everything for such people. In such acts, love is pure, and such practice of love gives the soul endurance and strength. I do not expect anything from creatures, and therefore I am not disappointed. I know that a creature is poor of itself, so what can one expect from it? God is everything for me; I want to evaluate everything according to God's ways (766).</p><p>I must always have a heart which is open to receive the sufferings of others, and drown my own sufferings in the Divine Heart so that they would not be noticed on the outside, in so far as possible (792).</p><p>My Master, cause my heart never to expect help from anyone, but I will always strive to bring assistance, consolation and all manner of relief to others. My heart is always open to the sufferings of others; and I will not close my heart to the sufferings of others, even though because of this I have been scornfully nicknamed \"dump\"; that is, [because] everyone dumps his pain into my heart. [To this] I answered that everyone has a place in my heart and I, in return, have a place in the Heart of Jesus. Taunts regarding the law of love will not narrow my heart. My soul is always sensitive on this point, and Jesus alone is the motive for my love of neighbor (871).</p><p>There is a woman here who was once one of our students. Naturally, she puts my patience to the test. She comes to see me several times a day. After each of these visits I am tired out, but I see that the Lord Jesus has sent that soul to me. Let everything glorify You, O Lord. Patience gives glory to God (920).</p><p>The knowledge of God's will came to me; that is to say, I now see everything from a higher point of view and accept all events and things, pleasant and unpleasant, with love, as tokens of the heavenly Father's special affection (956).</p><p>I suffer great pain at the sight of the sufferings of others. All these sufferings are reflected in my heart. I carry their torments in my heart so that it even wears me out physically. I would like all pains to fall upon me so as to bring relief to my neighbor (1039).</p><p>When I went out into the garden, I saw how everything was breathing the joy of spring. The trees, adorned with flowers, gave off an intoxicating odor. Everything was throbbing with joy, and the birds were singing and chirping their adoration of God and said to me, \"Rejoice and be happy, Sister Faustina;\" but my soul remains in torment and darkness. My soul is so sensitive to the rustle of grace [that] it knows how to talk with all created things and with everything that surrounds me, and I know why God has adorned the earth in this way (1120).</p><p>We resemble God most when we forgive our neighbors (1148).</p><p>My Jesus, penetrate me through and through so that I might be able to reflect You in my whole life. Divinize me so that my deeds may have supernatural value. Grant that I may have love, compassion and mercy for every soul without exception. O my Jesus, each of Your saints reflects one of Your virtues; I desire to reflect Your compassionate Heart, full of mercy; I want to glorify it. Let Your mercy, O Jesus, be impressed upon my heart and soul like a seal, and this will be my badge in this and the future life. Glorifying Your mercy is the exclusive task of my life (1242).</p><p>The Lord gave me to know how much He desires a soul to distinguish itself by deeds of love. And in spirit I saw how many souls are calling out to us, \"Give us God.\" (1249).</p><p>O Jesus, I see so much beauty scattered around me, beauty for which I give You constant thanks. But I see that some souls are like stone, always cold and unfeeling. Even miracles hardly move them. Their eyes are always fixed on their feet, and so they see nothing but themselves (1284).</p><p>During meditation, the sister on the kneeler next to mine keeps coughing and clearing her throat, sometimes without a break. It occurred to me once that I might take another place for the time of the meditation, because Mass had already been offered. But then I thought that if I did change my place, the sister would notice this and might feel hurt that I had moved away from her. So I decided to continue in prayer in my usual place, and to offer this act of patience to God. Toward the end of the meditation, my soul was flooded with God's consolation, and this to the limit of what my heart could bear; and the Lord gave me to know that if I had moved away from that sister I would have moved away also from those graces that flowed into my soul (1311).</p><p>I understand that mercy is manifold; one can do good always and everywhere and at all times. An ardent love of God sees all around itself constant opportunities to share itself through deed, word and prayer (1313).</p><p>[Many souls] <strong>are often worried because they do not have the material means with which to carry out an act of mercy. Yet spiritual mercy, which requires neither permissions nor storehouses, is much more meritorious and is within the grasp of every soul. If a soul does not exercise mercy somehow or other, it will not obtain My mercy on the day of judgment. Oh, if only souls knew how to gather eternal treasure for themselves, they would not be judged, for they would forestall My judgment with their mercy</strong> (1317).</p><p>When I hesitate on how to act in some situations, I always ask Love. It advises best (1354).</p><p><strong>It should be of no concern to you how anyone else acts; you are to be My living reflection, through love and mercy.</strong> I answered, \"Lord, but they often take advantage of my goodness.\" <strong>That makes no difference, My daughter. That is no concern of yours. As for you, be always merciful toward other people, and especially toward sinners</strong> (1446).</p><p>O God, give me a deeper faith that I may always see in [my neighbor] Your Holy Image which has been engraved in [his] soul (1522).</p><p><strong>Have great love for those who cause you suffering. Do good to those who hate you.</strong> I answered, \"O my Master, You see very well that I feel no love for them, and that troubles me.\" Jesus answered, <strong>It is not always within your power to control your feelings. You will recognize that you have love if, after having experienced annoyance and contradiction, you do not lose your peace, but pray for those who have made you suffer and wish them well</strong> (1628).</p><p><strong>My daughter, look into My Merciful Heart and reflect its compassion in your own heart and in your deeds, so that you, who proclaim My mercy to the world, may yourself be aflame with it</strong> (1688).</p><p><strong>Be always merciful as I am merciful. Love everyone out of love for Me, even your greatest enemies, so that My mercy may be fully reflected in your heart</strong> (1695).</p><p><strong>Know that whatever good you do to any soul, I accept it as if you had done it to Me</strong> (1768).</p><p><strong>My daughter, I desire that your heart be an abiding place of My mercy. I desire that this mercy flow out upon the whole world through your heart.

And when this will of God will seem to me very harsh and difficult to fulfill, it is then I beg You, Jesus, may power and strength flow upon me from Your wounds, and may my lips keep repeating, \"Your will be done, O Lord.\" O Savior of the world, Lover of man's salvation, who in such terrible torment and pain forget Yourself to think only of the salvation of souls, O most compassionate Jesus, grant me the grace to forget myself that I may live totally for souls, helping You in the work of salvation, according to the most holy will of Your Father (1264-1265).</p><p><strong>I want the eyes of your soul to be always fixed on My holy will, since it is in this way that you will please Me most. No sacrifices can be compared to this</strong> (1327)</p><p>The Mother of God gave me to experience the anxious concern she had in Her heart because of the Son of God. But this anxiety was permeated with such fragrance of abandonment to the will of God that I should call it rather a delight than an anxiety. I understood how my soul ought to accept the will of God in all things. It is a pity I cannot write this the way I experienced it (1437).</p><p>So today I submit myself completely and with loving consent to Your holy will, O Lord, and to Your most wise decrees, which are always full of clemency and mercy for me, though at times I can neither understand nor fathom them. O my Master, I surrender myself completely to You, who are the rudder of my soul; steer it Yourself according to Your divine wishes. I enclose myself in Your most compassionate Heart, which is a sea of unfathomable mercy (1450).</p><p><strong>Entrust yourself completely to My will saying, \"Not as I want, but according to Your will, O God, let it be done unto me.\" These words, spoken from the depths of one's heart, can raise a soul to the summit of sanctity in a short time. In such a soul I delight</strong> (1487).</p><p><strong>Be at peace, My child; nothing can oppose My will. &hellip; My will shall be done in you in all its fullness, down to the last detail of My wishes and My designs</strong> (1531).</p><p>    I want to live in the spirit of faith. I accept everything that comes my way as given me by the loving will of God, who sincerely desires my happiness. And so I will accept with submission and gratitude everything that God sends me (1549).</p><p>The Lord acts toward me in a mysterious manner. There are times when He Himself allows terrible sufferings, and then again there are times when He does not let me suffer and removes everything that might afflict my soul. These are His ways, unfathomable and incomprehensible to us. It is for us to submit ourselves completely to His holy will. There are mysteries that the human mind will never fathom here on earth; eternity will reveal them (1656).</p><p>I only want to do Your holy will. Although I have great enthusiasm, and the desires burning in my heart are immense, they are never above Your will (1729).</p>"

When, on one occasion, instead of interior prayer, I took up a book of spiritual reading, I heard these words spoken distinctly and forcefully within my soul, <strong>You will prepare the world for My final coming.</strong> These words moved me deeply, and although I pretended not to hear them, I understood them very well and had no doubt about them. Once, being tired out from this battle of love with God, and making constant excuses on the grounds that I was unable to carry out this task, I wanted to leave the chapel, but some force held me back and I found myself powerless.

When you lower and empty yourself before My majesty, I then pursue you with My graces and make use of My omnipotence to exalt you</strong> (576).</p><p>O my Jesus, nothing is better for the soul than humiliations. In contempt is the secret of happiness, when the soul recognizes that, of itself, it is only wretchedness and nothingness, and that whatever it possesses of good is a gift of God. When the soul sees that everything is given it freely and that the only thing it has of itself is its own misery, this is what sustains it in a continual act of humble prostration before the majesty of God. And God, seeing the soul in such a disposition, pursues it with His graces. As the soul continues to immerse itself more deeply into the abyss of its nothingness and need, God uses His omnipotence to exalt it. If there is a truly happy soul upon earth, it can only be a truly humble soul. At first, one's self-love suffers greatly on this account, but after a soul has struggled courageously, God grants it much light by which it sees how wretched and full of deception everything is. God alone is in its heart. A humble soul does not trust itself, but places all its confidence in God. God defends the humble soul and lets Himself into its secrets, and the soul abides in unsurpassable happiness which no one can comprehend (593).</p><p><strong>Without special help from Me, you are not even capable of accepting My graces. You know who you are</strong> (738).</p><p>God allows the soul to know how much He loves it, and the soul sees that better and holier souls than itself have not received this grace. Therefore, it is filled with holy amazement, which maintains it in deep humility, and it steeps itself in its own nothingness and holy astonishment; and the more it humbles itself, the more closely God unites himself with it and descends to it (771).</p><p>Oh, how happy is the soul who already here on earth enjoys His special favors! And of such are the little and humble souls (778).</p><p>The more I come to know the greatness of God, the more joyful I become that He is as He is. And I rejoice immensely in His greatness and am delighted that I am so little because, since I am little, He carries me in His arms and holds me close to His Heart (779).</p><p>The Lord, so very great though He is, delights in humble souls. The more a soul humbles itself, the greater the kindness with which the Lord approaches it (1092).</p><p><strong>Your humility draws Me down from My lofty throne, and I unite myself closely with you</strong> (1109).</p><p>O humility, lovely flower, I see how few souls possess you. Is it because you are so beautiful and at the same time so difficult to attain? O yes, it is both the one and the other. Even God takes great pleasure in her. The floodgates of heaven are open to a humble soul, and a sea of graces flows down upon her. O how beautiful is a humble soul! From her heart, as from a censer, rises a varied and most pleasing fragrance which breaks through the skies and reaches God Himself, filling His Most Sacred Heart with joy. God refuses nothing to such a soul; she is all-powerful and influences the destiny of the whole world. God raises such a soul up to His very throne, and the more she humbles herself, the more God stoops down to her, pursuing her with His graces and accompanying her at every moment with His omnipotence. Such a soul is most deeply united with God. O humility, strike deep roots in my whole being. O Virgin most pure, but also most humble, help me to attain deep humility. Now I understand why there are so few saints; it is because so few souls are deeply humble (1306).</p><p>[Mary:] <em>I desire, My dearly beloved daughter, that you practice the three virtues that are dearest to Me &mdash; and most pleasing to God. The first is humility, humility, and once again humility; the second virtue, purity; the third virtue, love of God</em> (1415).</p><p>Although You are great, Lord, You allow Yourself to be overcome by a lowly and deeply humble soul. O humility, the most precious of virtues, how few souls possess you! I see only a semblance of this virtue everywhere, but not the virtue itself. Lord, reduce me to nothingness in my own eyes that I may find grace in Yours (1436).</p><p>Oh, how good the Lord is in not letting me go astray! I know that He will guard me, even jealously, but only as long as I remain little, because it is with such that the great Lord likes to commune. As to proud souls, He watches them from afar and opposes them (1440).</p><p>\"Although You are so little, I know that You are God. Why do You take the appearance of such a little baby to commune with me?\" <strong>Because I want to teach you spiritual childhood. I want you to be very little, because when you are little, I carry you close to My Heart</strong> (1481).</p><p><strong>Because you are weak, I take you in My arms and carry you to the home of My Father</strong> (1486).</p><p>Little matter that often I hear people say that I am proud, for I know that human judgment does not discern the motives for our actions (1502).</p><p>When, at the beginning of my religious life, following the novitiate, I began to exercise myself particularly in humility, the humiliations that God sent me were not enough for me. And so, in my excessive zeal, I looked for more of them on my own, and I often represented myself to my superiors other than I was in reality and spoke of miseries of which I had no notion. But a short time later, Jesus gave me to know that humility is only the truth. From that time on, I changed my ideas, faithfully following the light of Jesus. I learned that if a soul is with Jesus, He will not permit it to err (1503).</p><p>I have learned that the greatest power is hidden in patience. I see that patience always leads to victory, although not immediately; but that victory will become manifest after many years. Patience is linked to meekness (1514).</p><p>O my Jesus, my only mercy, allow me to see contentment in Your face as a sign of reconciliation with me, because my heart cannot bear Your seriousness; if this continues a moment longer my heart will burst with grief. You see that I am even now crushed to dust.</p><p>And at that very moment I saw myself in some kind of a palace; and Jesus gave me His hand, sat me at His side, and said with kindness, <strong>My bride, you always please Me by your humility. The greatest misery does not stop Me from uniting Myself to a soul, but where there is pride, I am not there</strong> (1562-1563).</p><p><strong>My daughter,</strong> the Lord said, <strong>know that of yourself you are just what you have gone through</strong> [an excruciating spiritual darkness], <strong>and it is only by My grace that you are a participant of eternal life and all the gifts I lavish on you.</strong> And with these words of the Lord, there came to me a true knowledge of myself. Jesus is giving me a lesson in deep humility and, at the same time, one of total trust in Him. My heart is reduced to dust and ashes, and even if all people were to trample me under their feet, I would still consider that a favor.</p><p>I feel and am, in fact, very deeply permeated with the knowledge that I am nothing, so that real humiliations will be a refreshment for me (1559).</p><p><strong>Because you are a child, you shall remain close to My Heart. Your simplicity is more pleasing to Me than your mortifications</strong> (1617).</p><p><strong>Strive to make your heart like unto My humble and gentle Heart. Never claim your rights. Bear with great calm and patience everything that befalls you. Do not defend yourself when you are put to shame, though innocent. Let others triumph. Do not stop being good when you notice that your goodness is being abused. I Myself will speak up for you when it is necessary</strong> (1701).</p><p>When I was left alone with the Blessed Virgin, She instructed me concerning the interior life. She said, <em>The soul's true greatness is in loving God and in humbling oneself in His presence, completely forgetting oneself and believing oneself to be nothing; because the Lord is great, but He is well pleased only with the humble; He always opposes the proud</em> (1711).</p><p>O my Jesus, You know that there are times when I have neither lofty thoughts nor a soaring spirit. I bear with myself patiently and admit that that is just what I am, because all that is beautiful is a grace from God. And so I humble myself profoundly and cry out for Your help; and the grace of visitation is not slow in coming to the humble heart (1734).</p>"

I am never alone, because He is my constant companion (318).</p><p>I have only one trusted friend in whom I confide everything, and that is Jesus &mdash; the Eucharist, and His representative &mdash; my confessor (504).</p><p>O my Jesus &hellip; I expect no help from people; all my hope is in You (650).</p><p>I have understood that at certain and most difficult moments I shall be alone, deserted by everyone, and that I must face all the storms and fight with all the strength of my soul, even with those from whom I expected to get help.</p><p>But I am not alone, because Jesus is with me, and with Him I fear nothing. I am well aware of everything, and I know what God is demanding of me. Suffering, contempt, ridicule, persecution, and humiliation will be my constant lot. I know no other way.

I am bringing you into seclusion so that I Myself may form your heart according to My future plans</strong> (797).</p><p>An extraordinary yearning fills my soul. I am surprised that it does not separate the soul from the body. I desire God; I want to become immersed in Him. I understand that I am in a terrible exile; my soul aspires for God with all its might. O you inhabitants of my fatherland, be mindful of this exile! When will the veils be lifted for me as well? Although I see and feel to a certain extent how very thin is the veil separating me from the Lord, I long to see Him face to face; but let everything be done according to Your will (807).</p><p>Today I felt bad that a week had gone by and no one had come to visit me. When I complained to the Lord, He answered, <strong>Isn't it enough for you that I visit you every day?</strong> I apologized to the Lord and the hurt vanished. O God, my strength, You are sufficient for me (827).</p><p>I marvel at how many humiliations and sufferings [Fr. Sopocko] accepts in this whole matter. &hellip; The Lord has few such souls. &hellip; Such souls do not have friends; they are solitary. And in this solitude, they gain strength; they draw their strength from God alone. With humility, but also with courage, they stand firmly in the face of all the storms that beat upon them. Like high-towering oaks, they are unmoved. And in this there is just this one secret: that it's from God that they draw this strength, and everything whatsoever they have need of, they have for themselves and for others. They not only carry their own burden, but also know how to take on, and are capable of taking on, the burdens of others. They are pillars of light along God's ways; they live in light themselves and shed light upon others. They themselves live on the heights, and know how to show the way to lesser ones and help them attain those heights (838).</p><p>Oh, what infinite longing envelops my soul! Jesus, how can You still leave me in this exile? I am dying of longing for You. Every touch of my soul by You wounds me immensely. Love and suffering go together; yet I would not exchange this pain caused by You for any treasure, because it is the pain of incomprehensible delights, and these wounds of the soul are inflicted by a loving hand (843).</p><p>During the morning meditation, I felt an aversion and a repugnance for all created things. Everything pales before my eyes; my spirit is detached from all things. I desire only God Himself, and yet I must live. This is a martyrdom beyond description. God imparts Himself to the soul in a loving way and draws it into the infinite depths of His divinity, but at the same time He leaves it here on earth for the sole purpose that it might suffer and die of longing for Him. And this strong love is so pure that God Himself finds pleasure in it; and selflove has no access to its deeds, for here everything is totally saturated with bitterness, and thus is totally pure. Life is a continuous dying, painful and terrible, and at the same time it is the depth of true life and of inconceivable happiness and the strength of the soul; and because of this, [the soul] is capable of great deeds for the sake of God (856).</p><p>My heart is steeped in continual bitterness, because I want to go to You, Lord, into the fullness of life. O Jesus, what a dreadful wilderness this life seems to me! There is on this earth no nourishment for either my heart or my soul. I suffer because of my longing for You, O Lord. You have left me the Sacred Host, O Lord, but it enkindles in my soul an even greater longing for You, O my Creator and Eternal God! Jesus, I yearn to become united with You. Deign to hear the sighs of Your dearly beloved. Oh, how I suffer because I am still unable to be united with You. But let it be done according to Your wishes (867).</p><p>O Jesus concealed in the Host, my sweet Master and faithful Friend, how happy my soul is to have such a Friend who always keeps me company. I do not feel lonely even though I am in isolation. Jesus-Host, we know each other &mdash; that is enough for me (877).</p><p>Although the earth is so filled with people, I feel all alone, and the earth is a terrible desert to me. O Jesus, Jesus, You know and understand the fervors of my heart; You, O Lord, alone can fill me (918).</p><p>I do not fear at all being abandoned by creatures because, even if all abandoned me, I would not be alone, for the Lord is with me (1022).</p><p>There is no greater happiness than when God gives me to know interiorly that every beat of my heart is pleasing to Him, and when He shows me that He loves me in a special way (1121).</p><p>Oh, how much I feel I am in exile! I see that no one understands my interior life. You alone understand me, You who are hidden in my heart and yet are eternally alive (1141).</p><p>I would have liked to hide and rest for a while in solitude, in a word, to be alone. At such moments, no creature is capable of giving me comfort, and even if I had wanted to say something about myself, I would have experienced new anguish. Therefore, I have kept silent at such moments and submitted myself, in silence, to the will of God &mdash; and that has given me relief. I demand nothing from creatures and communicate with them only in so far as is necessary. I will not take them into my confidence unless this is for the greater glory of God (1200).</p><p>During this conversation, I came to know [Fr. Sopocko's] anguished soul. This crucified soul resembles the Savior. Where he expects, with good reason, to find consolation, he finds the cross. He lives among many friends, but has no one but Jesus. This is how God strips the soul He especially loves (1259).</p><p>With great longing, I gaze upon you, my homeland,<br />When will this, my exile, come to an end?<br />O Jesus, such is the call of Your bride<br />Who suffers agony in her thirst for You (1304).</p><p>In the greatest torments of soul I am always alone, but no &mdash; not alone, for I am with You, Jesus; but here I am speaking about [other] people. None of them understands my heart, but this does not surprise me anymore (1445).</p><p><strong>I realize how painful it is not to be understood, and especially by those whom one loves and with whom one has been very open. &hellip; Learn from this that no one will understand a soul entirely &mdash; that is beyond human ability. Therefore, I have remained on earth to comfort your aching heart and to fortify your soul, so that you will not falter on the way</strong> (1487).</p><p><strong>My child, make the resolution never to rely on people. Entrust yourself completely to My will</strong> (1487).</p><p>When the chaplain brought me Holy Communion, I had to control myself by sheer effort of will to keep from crying out at the top of my voice, \"Welcome, my true and only Friend!\" (1509).</p><p><strong>Even among the sisters you will feel lonely. Know then that I want you to unite yourself more closely to Me. I am concerned about every beat of your heart. Every stirring of your love is reflected in My Heart. I thirst for your love</strong> (1542).</p><p>Although loneliness and darkness and sufferings of all kinds beat against my heart, the mysterious power of God supports and strengthens me (1580).</p><p>Although the times of loneliness are terrible, You make them sweet for me (1655).</p><p>When boredom and discouragement beat against your heart, run away from yourself and hide in My Heart (1760).</p>"

These souls will not be judged severely, but Your mercy will embrace them as they depart from this life.</p><p>Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon the souls who glorify and venerate Your greatest attribute, that of Your fathomless mercy, and who are enclosed in the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. These souls are a living Gospel; their hands are full of deeds of mercy, and their spirit, overflowing with joy, sings a canticle of mercy to You, O Most High! I beg You, O God: Show them Your mercy according to the hope and trust they have placed in You. Let there be accomplished in them the promise of Jesus, who said to them, <strong>I Myself will defend as My own glory, during their lifetime, and especially at the hour of their death, those souls who will venerate My fathomless mercy</strong> (1224-1225).</p><p>* The text leads one to conclude that in the first prayer directed to Jesus, who is the Redeemer, it is \"victim\" souls and contemplatives that are being prayed for; those persons, that is, that voluntarily offered themselves to God for the salvation of their neighbor (see Col 1:24; 2 Cor 4:12). This explains their close union with the Savior and the extraordinary efficacy that their invisible activity has for others. In the second prayer, directed to the Father from whom comes \"every worthwhile gift and every genuine benefit,\" we recommend the \"active\" souls, who promote devotion to Divine Mercy and exercise with it all the other works that lend themselves to the spiritual and material uplifting of their brethren.</p><p><em>EIGHTH DAY.</em> <strong>Today bring to Me the souls who are in the prison of Purgatory, and immerse them in the abyss of My mercy. Let the torrents of My Blood cool down their scorching flames. All these souls are greatly loved by Me. They are making retribution to My justice. It is in your power to bring them relief. Draw all the indulgences from the treasury of My Church and offer them on their behalf. Oh, if you only knew the torments they suffer, you would continually offer for them the alms of the spirit and pay off their debt to My justice.</strong></p><p>Most Merciful Jesus, You Yourself have said that You desire mercy; so I bring into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart the souls in Purgatory, souls who are very dear to You, and yet, who must make retribution to Your justice. May the streams of Blood and Water which gushed forth from Your Heart put out the flames of the purifying fire, that in that place, too, the power of Your mercy may be praised.</p><p>Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon the souls suffering in Purgatory, who are enfolded in the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. I beg You, by the sorrowful Passion of Jesus Your Son, and by all the bitterness with which His most sacred Soul was flooded, manifest Your mercy to the souls who are under Your just scrutiny. Look upon them in no other way than through the Wounds of Jesus, Your dearly beloved Son; for we firmly believe that there is no limit to Your goodness and compassion (1226-1227).</p><p><em>NINTH DAY.</em> <strong>Today bring to Me souls who have become lukewarm,* and immerse them in the abyss of My mercy. These souls wound My Heart most painfully. My soul suffered the most dreadful loathing in the Garden of Olives because of lukewarm souls. They were the reason I cried out: \"Father, take this cup away from Me, if it be Your will.\" For them, the last hope of salvation is to flee to My mercy.</strong></p><p>Most Compassionate Jesus, You are Compassion Itself. I bring lukewarm souls into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart. In this fire of Your pure love let these tepid souls, who, like corpses, filled You with such deep loathing, be once again set aflame. O Most Compassionate Jesus, exercise the omnipotence of Your mercy and draw them into the very ardor of Your love; and bestow upon them the gift of holy love, for nothing is beyond Your power.</p><p>Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon lukewarm souls, who are nonetheless enfolded in the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. Father of Mercy, I beg You by the bitter Passion of Your Son and by His three-hour agony on the Cross: Let them, too, glorify the abyss of Your mercy (1228-1229).</p><p>* To understand who are the souls designated for this day, and who in the Diary are called \"lukewarm,\" but are also compared to ice and to corpses, we would do well to take note of the definition that the Savior Himself gave them when speaking to St. Faustina about them on one occasion: <strong>There are souls who thwart My efforts </strong>(1682)<strong>. Souls without love or devotion, souls full of egoism and selfishness, proud and arrogant souls full of deceit and hypocrisy, lukewarm souls who have just enough warmth to keep themselves alive: My Heart cannot bear this. All the graces I pour out upon them flow off them as off the face of a rock. I cannot stand them because they are neither good nor bad </strong>(1702).</p>"

Oh, such an inconceivable agony! How terribly Jesus suffered during the scourging! O poor sinners, on the day of judgment how will you face the Jesus whom you are now torturing so cruelly? His blood flowed to the ground, and in some places His flesh started to fall off. I saw a few bare bones on His back. The meek Jesus moaned softly and sighed (188).</p><p>I please Him best by meditating on His sorrowful Passion (267).</p><p>O my Jesus, my only hope, thank You for the book which You have opened before my soul's eyes. That book is Your Passion which You underwent for love of me. It is from this book that I have learned how to love God and souls. In this book there are found for us inexhaustible treasures. O Jesus, how few souls understand You in Your martyrdom of love! Oh, how great is the fire of purest love which burns in Your Most Sacred Heart! Happy the soul that has come to understand the love of the Heart of Jesus! (304).</p><p>When I become immersed in the Lord's Passion, I often see the Lord Jesus, during adoration, in this manner: after the scourging, the torturers took the Lord and stripped Him of His own garment, which had already adhered to the wounds; as they took it off, His wounds reopened; then they threw a dirty and tattered scarlet cloak over the fresh wounds of the Lord. The cloak, in some places, barely reached His knees. They made Him sit on a piece of beam. And then they wove a crown of thorns, which they put on His sacred head. They put a reed in His hand and made fun of Him, bowing to Him as to a king. Some spat in His face, while others took the reed and struck Him on the head with it. Others caused Him pain by slapping Him; still others covered His face and struck Him with their fists. Jesus bore all this with meekness. Who can comprehend Him &mdash; comprehend His suffering? Jesus' eyes were downcast. I sensed what was happening in the most sweet Heart of Jesus at that time. Let every soul reflect on what Jesus was suffering at that moment. They tried to outdo each other in insulting the Lord. I reflected: Where does such malice in man come from? It is caused by sin. Love and sin have met (408).</p><p>When I came for adoration, an inner recollection took hold of me immediately, and I saw the Lord Jesus tied to a pillar, stripped of His clothes, and the scourging began immediately. I saw four men who took turns at striking the Lord with scourges. My heart almost stopped at the sight of these tortures. The Lord said to me, <strong>I suffer even greater pain than that which you see.</strong> And Jesus gave me to know for what sins He subjected himself to the scourging: these are sins of impurity. Oh, how dreadful was Jesus' moral suffering during the scourging! Then Jesus said to me, <strong>Look and see the human race in its present condition.</strong> In an instant, I saw horrible things: the executioners left Jesus, and other people started scourging Him; they seized the scourges and struck the Lord mercilessly. These were priests, religious men and women; and high dignitaries of the Church, which surprised me greatly. There were lay people of all ages and walks of life. All vented their malice on the innocent Jesus. Seeing this, my heart fell as if into a mortal agony. And while the executioners had been scourging Him, Jesus had been silent and looking into the distance; but when those other souls I mentioned scourged Him, Jesus closed His eyes, and a soft, but most painful moan escaped from His Heart. And Jesus gave me to know in detail the gravity of the malice of these ungrateful souls: <strong>You see, this is a torture greater than My death.</strong> Then my lips too fell silent, and I began to experience the agony of death, and I felt that no one would comfort me or snatch me from that state but the One who had put me into it. Then the Lord said to me, <strong>I see the sincere pain of your heart which brought great solace to My Heart. See and take comfort</strong> (445).</p><p>Palm Sunday. This Sunday, I experienced in a special way the sentiments of the most sweet Heart of Jesus. My spirit was there where Jesus was. I saw Jesus riding on a donkey's foal, and the disciples and a great multitude with branches in their hands joyfullyaccompanying the Lord Jesus. Some strewed them before His feet where He was riding, while others raised their branches in the air, leaping and jumping before the Lord and not knowing what to do for joy. And I saw another crowd which came out to meet Jesus, likewise with joyful faces and with branches in their hands, and they were crying out unceasingly with joy. There were little children there also. But Jesus was very grave, and the Lord gave me to know how much He was suffering at the time. And at that moment, I saw nothing but only Jesus, whose Heart was saturated with ingratitude (642).</p><p><strong>It is in My Passion that you must seek light and strength.</strong> After the confession, I meditated on Jesus' terrible Passion, and I understood that what I was suffering was nothing compared to the Savior's Passion, and that even the smallest imperfection was the cause of this terrible suffering (654).</p><p>Jesus allowed me to enter the Cenacle, and I was a witness to what happened there. However, I was most deeply moved when, before the Consecration, Jesus raised His eyes to heaven and entered into a mysterious conversation with His Father. It is only in eternity that we shall really understand that moment. His eyes were like two flames; His face was radiant, white as snow; His whole personage full of majesty, His soul full of longing. At the moment of Consecration, love rested satiated &mdash; the sacrifice fully consummated. Now only the external ceremony of death will be carried out &mdash; external destruction; the essence [of it] is in the Cenacle. Never in my whole life had I understood this mystery so profoundly as during that hour of adoration. Oh, how ardently I desire that the whole world would come to know this unfathomable mystery! (684).</p><p>This evening, I saw the Lord Jesus just as He was during His Passion. His eyes were raised up to His Father, and He was praying for us (736).</p><p><strong>There are few souls who contemplate My Passion with true feeling; I give great graces to souls who meditate devoutly on My Passion</strong> (737).</p><p>Today, during the Passion Service, I saw Jesus being tortured and crowned with thorns and holding a reed in His hand. Jesus was silent as the soldiers were bustling about, vying with each other in torturing Him. Jesus said nothing, but just looked at me, and in that gaze I felt His pain, so terrible that we have not the faintest idea of how much He suffered for us before He was crucified. &hellip; When I see Jesus tormented, my heart is torn to pieces, and I think: what will become of sinners if they do not take advantage of the Passion of Jesus: In His Passion, I see a whole sea of mercy (948).</p><p><strong>And when it seems to you that your suffering exceeds your strength, contemplate My wounds, and you will rise above human scorn and judgment. Meditation on My Passion will help you rise above all things</strong> (1184).</p><p>I saw the suffering Savior. What struck me was that Jesus was so peaceful amidst His great sufferings. I understood that this was a lesson for me on what my outward behavior should be in the midst of my various sufferings (1467).</p><p><strong>My daughter, meditate frequently on the sufferings which I have undergone for your sake, and then nothing of what you suffer for Me will seem great to you. You please Me most when you meditate on My Sorrowful Passion.

During Mass, Jesus gave me to know the pain of His soul, and I could clearly feel how the hymns of <em>Hosanna</em> reverberated as a painful echo in His Sacred Heart. My soul, too, was inundated by a sea of bitterness, and each <em>Hosanna</em> pierced my own heart to its depths. My whole soul was drawn close to Jesus. I heard Jesus' voice: <strong>My daughter, your compassion for Me refreshes Me. By meditating on My Passion, your soul acquires a distinct beauty</strong> (1657).</p><p><strong>Look into My Heart and see there the love and mercy which I have for humankind, and especially for sinners. Look, and enter into My Passion</strong> (1663).</p><p><strong>My daughter, today consider My Sorrowful Passion in all its immensity.

The soul will not  attain sanctity if it does not keep watch over its tongue (92).</p><p>In order to hear the voice of God, one has to have silence in  one's soul and to keep silence; not a gloomy silence, but an  interior silence; that is to say, recollection in God. One can  speak a great deal without breaking silence and, on the contrary,  one can speak little and be constantly breaking silence. &hellip; God  does not give Himself to a chattering soul which, like a drone in  a beehive, buzzes around but gathers no honey.

I am never alone,  because He is my constant companion (318).</p><p>I sense His divine gaze; I have long talks with Him without  saying a word (411).</p><p>If only souls would become recollected, God would speak to  them at once, for dissipation drowns out the word of the  Lord (452).</p><p>Silence is a sword in the spiritual struggle. A talkative soul will  never attain sanctity. The sword of silence will cut off everything  that would like to cling to the soul. We are sensitive to words  and quickly want to answer back, without taking any regard as  to whether it is God's will that we should speak. A silent soul is  strong; no adversities will harm it if it perseveres in silence. The  silent soul is capable of attaining the closest union with God. It  lives almost always under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. God  works in a silent soul without hindrance (477).</p><p>I try to keep You company throughout the day, I do not  leave You alone for even a moment. Although I am in the  company of other people or with our wards, my heart is always united to Him. When I am asleep I offer Him every beat of my heart; when I awaken I immerse myself in Him without saying a word. When I awaken I adore the Holy Trinity for a short while and thank God for having deigned to give me yet another day, that the mystery of the incarnation of His Son may once more be repeated in me, and that once again His sorrowful Passion may unfold before my eyes. I then try to make it easier for Jesus to pass through me to other souls. I go everywhere with Jesus; His presence accompanies me everywhere (486).</p><p>I will safeguard my interior and exterior silence so that Jesus can rest in my heart (504).</p><p>The Holy Spirit does not speak to a soul that is distracted and garrulous. He speaks by His quiet inspirations to a soul that is recollected, to a soul that knows how to keep silence. If silence were strictly observed, there would not be any grumbling, bitterness, slandering, or gossip, and charity would not be tarnished. In a word, many wrongs would not be done. Silent lips are pure gold and bear witness to holiness within (552).</p><p>Keeping silent when one ought to speak is an imperfection and sometimes even a sin (553).</p><p>The Mother of God told me to do what She had done, that, even when joyful, I should always keep my eyes fixed on the cross (561).</p><p>[Mary:] <em>My daughter, strive after silence and humility, so that Jesus, who dwells in your heart continuously, may be able to rest.

I didn't know that men were such chatterboxes. From morning till late at night, there is talk about various subjects. The women's ward is much quieter. It is women who are always blamed for this; but I have had occasion to be convinced that the opposite is true. It is very difficult for me to concentrate on my prayer in the midst of these jokes and this laughter. They do not disturb me when the grace of God takes complete possession of me, because then I do not know what is going on around me.</p><p>My Jesus, how little these people talk about You. They talk about everything but You, Jesus. And if they talk so little [about You], it is quite probable that they do not think about You at all.

One act of trust at such moments gives greater glory to God than whole hours passed in prayer filled with consolations (78).</p><p><strong>It is not for the success of a work, but for the suffering that I give reward </strong>(90).</p><p>Once during an adoration, the Lord demanded that I give myself up to Him as an offering, by bearing a certain suffering in atonement, not only for the sins of the world in general, but specifically for transgressions committed in this house. Immediately I said, \"Very good; I am ready.\" But Jesus gave me to see what I was going to suffer, and in one moment the whole passion unfolded itself before my eyes. Firstly, my intentions will not be recognized; there will be all kinds of suspicion and distrust as well as various kinds of humiliations and adversities. I will not mention everything here. All these things stood before my soul's eye like a dark storm from which lightning was ready to strike at any moment, waiting only for my consent. For a moment, my nature was frightened. Then suddenly the dinner bell rang. I left the chapel, trembling and undecided. But the sacrifice was ever present before me, for I had neither decided to accept it, nor had I refused the Lord. I wanted to place myself completely in His will. If the Lord Jesus Himself were to impose it on me, I was ready. But Jesus gave me to know that I myself was to give my free consent and accept it with full consciousness, or else it would be meaningless. Its whole power was contained in my free act before God. But at the same time, Jesus gave me to understand that the decision was completely within my power. I could do it or not do it. And so I then answered immediately, \"Jesus, I accept everything that You wish to send me; I trust in Your goodness.\" At that moment, I felt that by this act I glorified God greatly. But I armed myself with patience. As soon as I left the chapel, I had an encounter with reality. I do not want to describe the details, but there was as much of it as I was able to bear. I would not have been able to bear even one drop more (190).</p><p>In suffering, I must be patient and quiet, knowing that everything passes in time (253).</p><p>True works of God always meet opposition and are marked by suffering (270).</p><p>Great love can change small things into great ones, and it is only love which lends value to our actions. And the purer our love becomes, the less there will be within us for the flames of suffering to feed upon, and the suffering will cease to be a suffering for us; it will become a delight! By the grace of God, I have received such a disposition of heart that I am never so happy as when I suffer for Jesus, whom I love with every beat of my heart (303).</p><p>Once when I was suffering greatly, I left my work and escaped to Jesus and asked Him to give me His strength. After a very short prayer I returned to my work filled with enthusiasm and joy. Then, one of the sisters said to me, \"You must have many consolations today, Sister; you look so radiant. Surely, God is giving you no suffering, but only consolations.\" \"You are greatly mistaken, Sister,\" I answered, \"for it is precisely when I suffer much that my joy is greater; and when I suffer less, my joy also is less.\" However, that soul was letting me recognize that she does not understand what I was saying. I tried to explain to her that when we suffer much we have a great chance to show God that we love Him; but when we suffer little we have less occasion to show God our love; and when we do not suffer at all, our love is then neither great nor pure. By the grace of God, we can attain a point where suffering will become a delight to us, for love can work such things in pure souls (303).</p><p>Once, the Mother of God came to visit me. She was sad. Her eyes were cast down. She made it clear that She wanted to say something, and yet, on the other hand, it was as if She did not want to speak to me about it. When I understood this, I began to beg the Mother of God to tell me and to look at me. Just then Mary looked at me with a warm smile and said, <em>You are going to experience certain sufferings because of an illness and the doctors; you will also suffer much because of the image, but do not be afraid of anything </em>(316).</p><p><strong>There is but one price at which souls are bought, and that is suffering united to My suffering on the Cross </strong>(324).</p><p>Suffering is the greatest treasure on earth; it purifies the soul. In suffering we learn who is our true friend (342).</p><p>True love is measured by the thermometer of suffering. Jesus, I thank You for the little daily crosses, for opposition to my endeavors, for the hardships of communal life, for the misinterpretation of my intentions, for humiliations at the hands of others, for the harsh way in which we are treated, for false suspicions, for poor health and loss of strength, for self-denial, for dying to myself, for lack of recognition in everything, for the upsetting of all my plans.</p><p>Thank You, Jesus, for interior sufferings, for dryness of spirit, for terrors, fears and incertitudes, for the darkness and the deep interior night, for temptations and various ordeals, for torments too difficult to describe, especially for those which no one will understand, for the hour of death with its fierce struggle and all its bitterness (343).</p><p>Then I saw the Lord Jesus nailed to the Cross. When He had hung on it for a while, I saw a multitude of souls crucified like Him. Then I saw a second multitude of souls, and a third. The second multitude were not nailed to [their] crosses, but were holding them firmly in their hands. The third were neither nailed to [their] crosses nor holding them firmly in their hands, but were dragging [their] crosses behind them and were discontent. Jesus then said to me, <strong>Do you see these souls? Those who are like Me in the pain and contempt they suffer will be like Me also in glory. And those who resemble Me less in pain and contempt will also bear less resemblance to Me in glory </strong>(446).</p><p>In the midst of all sufferings, both physical and spiritual, as well as in darkness and desolation, I will remain silent, like a dove, and not complain (504).</p><p>And the Lord also gave me to understand what unimaginable glory awaits the person who resembles the suffering Jesus here on earth. That person will resemble Jesus in His glory. The Heavenly Father will recognize and glorify our soul to the extent that He sees in us a resemblance to His Son. I understood that this assimilation into Jesus is granted to us while we are here on earth. &hellip;</p><p>O Holy Trinity, Eternal God, I thank You for allowing me to know the greatness and the various degrees of glory to which souls attain. Oh, what a great difference of depth in the knowledge of God there is between one degree and another! Oh, if people could only know this! O my God, if I were thereby able to attain one more degree, I would gladly suffer all the torments of the martyrs put together. Truly, all those torments seem as nothing to me compared with the glory that is awaiting us for all eternity (604-605).</p><p>[Mary:] <em>Fear nothing. Be faithful to the end.

When I am silent, I know I shall be victorious (896).</p><p>In difficult moments, I will fix my gaze upon the silent Heart of Jesus, stretched upon the Cross, and from the exploding flames of His merciful Heart, will flow down upon me power and strength to keep fighting (906).</p><p><strong>My child, rest on My Heart; I see that you have worked hard in My vineyard </strong>(945).</p><p>Oh, if only the suffering soul knew how it is loved by God, it would die of joy and excess of happiness!

I am not forcing myself further, but simply submitting my will to the will of Jesus (1204).</p><p>I have come to see that if the will of the Heavenly Father was fulfilled in this way in His well-beloved Son, it will be fulfilled in us in exactly the same way: by suffering, persecution, abuse, disgrace. It is through all this that my soul becomes like unto Jesus. And the greater the sufferings, the more I see that I am becoming like Jesus. This is the surest way. If some other way were better, Jesus would have shown it to me. Sufferings in no way take away my peace. On the other hand, although I enjoy profound peace, that peace does not lessen my experience of suffering. Although my face is often bowed to the ground, and my tears flow profusely, at the same time my soul is filled with profound peace and happiness (1394).</p><p>God, in his unfathomable decrees, often allows it to be that those who have expended most effort in accomplishing some work do not enjoy its fruits here on earth; God reserves all their joy for eternity. But for all that, God sometimes lets them know how much their efforts please Him. And such moments strengthen them for further struggles and ordeals. These are the souls that bear closest resemblance to the Savior who, in the work which He founded here on earth, tasted nothing but bitterness (1402).</p><p>I do not ask, Lord, that You take me down from the cross, but I implore You to give me the strength to remain steadfast upon it (1484).</p><p><strong>I am giving you a share in </strong>[My] <strong>sufferings because of My special love for you and in view of the high degree of holiness I am intending for you in heaven. A suffering soul is closest to My Heart </strong>(1487).</p><p>Jesus, do not leave me alone in suffering. You know, Lord, how weak I am. I am an abyss of wretchedness, I am nothingness itself; so what will be so strange if You leave me alone and I fall? I am an infant, Lord, so I cannot get along by myself. However, beyond all abandonment I trust, and in spite of my own feeling I trust, and I am being completely transformed into trust &mdash; often in spite of what I feel. Do not lessen any of my sufferings, only give me strength to bear them. Do with me as You please, Lord, only give me the grace to be able to love You in every event and circumstance. Lord, do not lessen my cup of bitterness, only give me strength that I may be able to drink it all (1489).</p><p>O my Jesus, how good it is to be on the cross, but with You! (1609).</p><p>I am uniting myself with Jesus through suffering. When I meditate on His Painful Passion, my physical sufferings are lessened (1625).</p><p>Once again, I am feeling worse today. A high fever is beginning to consume me, and I cannot take any food. I would like to have something refreshing to drink, but there is not even any water in my pitcher. All this, O Jesus, to obtain mercy for souls (1647).</p><p>Accept, most merciful Jesus, this, my inadequate sacrifice, which I offer to You today before heaven and earth. May Your Most Sacred Heart, so full of mercy, complete what is lacking in my offering, and offer it to Your Father for the conversion of sinners. I thirst after souls, O Christ (1680).</p><p><strong>My daughter, know that if I allow you to feel and have a more profound knowledge of My sufferings, that is a grace from Me. But when your mind is dimmed and your sufferings are great, it is then that you take an active part in My Passion, and I am conforming you more fully to Myself. It is your task to submit yourself to My will at such times, more than at others </strong>(1697).</p><p>O my Jesus, give me strength to endure suffering so that I may not make a wry face when I drink the cup of bitterness. Help me Yourself to make my sacrifice pleasing to You. May it not be tainted by my self-love, even though it extend over many years. May purity of intention make it pleasing to You, fresh and full of life. This life of mine is a ceaseless struggle, a constant effort to do Your holy will; but may everything that is in me, both my misery and my strength, give praise to You, O Lord (1740).</p><p>In order to gain merit for my suffering, I will unite myself more closely, in suffering, to the Passion of the Lord Jesus, asking of Him grace for dying souls, so that the mercy of God may embrace them in this grave moment (1762).</p><p><strong>You will save more souls through prayer and suffering than will a missionary through his teachings and sermons alone </strong>(1767).</p><p><strong>When, in heaven, you see these present days </strong>[of suffering]<strong>, you will rejoice and will want to see as many of them as possible </strong>(1787).</p><p>My God, although my sufferings are great and protracted, I accept them from Your hands as magnificent gifts. I accept them all, even the ones that other souls have refused to accept. You can come to me with everything, my Jesus; I will refuse You nothing. I ask You for only one thing: give me the strength to endure them and grant that they may be meritorious. Here is my whole being; do with me as You please (1795).</p><p>May Your grace, which flows down upon me from Your Compassionate Heart, strengthen me for the struggle and sufferings, that I may remain faithful to You. And, although I am such misery, I do not fear You, because I know Your mercy well. Nothing will frighten me away from You, O God, because everything is so much less than what I know [Your mercy to be] &mdash; I see that clearly (1803).</p><p>If the angels were capable of envy, they would envy us for two things: one is the receiving of Holy Communion, and the other is suffering (1804). </p>"

I have given myself over to His holy will; let Him do with me as He wishes, and I will still love Him (589).</p><p>I then pleaded with Jesus for a certain soul [Father Sopocko], asking the Lord to grant him the grace to fight, and to take this trial from him. <strong>As you ask, so shall it be, but his merit will not be lessened. </strong>Joy reigned in my soul that God is so good and merciful; God grants everything that we ask of Him with trust (609).</p><p><strong>I desire that the whole world know My infinite mercy.

She told me that, beginning with her perpetual vows, she would practice trust.

Why was your soul fearful for a moment? </strong>I apologized to the Lord for that moment. Jesus wants me to always be a child and to leave all care to Him, and to submit blindly to His holy will.

The Lord's will with regard to its establishment was already made known in His first revelation to the saint. In all, there were 14 revelations concerning the desired feast. The most comprehensive revelation can be found in <em>Diary </em>entry 699:</p><i><p><strong>My daughter, tell the whole world about My inconceivable mercy. I desire that the Feast of Mercy be a refuge and a shelter for all souls, and especially for poor sinners. On that day the very depths of My tender mercy are open. I pour out a whole ocean of graces upon those souls who approach the fount of My mercy.</strong></p><p><strong>The soul that will go to Confession and receive Holy Communion shall obtain complete forgiveness of sins and punishment. On that day are opened all the divine floodgates through which graces flow. Let no soul fear to draw near to Me, even though its sins be as scarlet.</strong></p><p><strong>My mercy is so great that no mind, be it of man or of angel, will be able to fathom it throughout all eternity. Everything that exists has come from the very depths of My most tender mercy. Every soul in its relation to Me will contemplate My love and mercy throughout eternity.</strong></p><p><strong>The Feast of Mercy emerged from My very depths of tenderness. It is My desire that it be solemnly celebrated on the first Sunday after Easter. Mankind will not have peace until it turns to the Fount of My mercy.</strong></p></i><p>Our Lord's explicit desire is that this feast be celebrated on the first Sunday after Easter. In the Liturgy of the Hours and the Celebration of the Eucharist, this Sunday is designated as the \"Octave Day of Easter.\" It was officially called \"The Second Sunday of Easter\" after the liturgical reform of Vatican II. Now, by the Decree of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the name of this liturgical day has been changed to \"Second Sunday of Easter, or Divine Mercy Sunday.\"</p><p>Pope John Paul II made the surprise announcement of this change in his homily at the canonization of Sr. Faustina on April 30, 2000.  He declared: \"It is important then that we accept the whole message that comes to us from the word of God on this Second Sunday of Easter, which from now on throughout the Church, <em>will be called \"Divine Mercy Sunday.\"</em> \"</p><p>By the words \"the whole message,\" Pope John Paul II was referring to the connection between the \"Easter Mystery of the Redemption\", in other words, the suffering, death, burial, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, followed by the sending of the Holy Spirit, and this Feast of Divine Mercy, the Octave Day of Easter.</p><p>This connection is evident from the scripture readings appointed for this Sunday. As John Paul said, citing the Responsorial Psalm of the Liturgy, \"The Church sings, as if receiving from Christ's lips these words of the Psalm.\" \"Give thanks to the Lord for He is good; His steadfast love (= mercy) endures forever\" (Ps 118:1). And then, Pope John Paul II developed the connection further: \"[This comes] from the lips of the risen Christ, who bears the great message of Divine Mercy and entrusts its ministry to the Apostles in the Upper Room: \"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me, even so I send you. Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained\" (Jn 20:21-23).</p><p>During his homily, John Paul also made clear that the Image of The Divine Mercy St. Faustina saw, which is to be venerated on Mercy Sunday, represents the Risen Christ bringing mercy to the world. (See <em>Diary, </em>49, 88, 299, 341, 570, 742.) Pope John Paul II said: </p><i><p> Jesus shows His hands and His side [to the Apostles]. He points, that is, to the wounds of the Passion, especially the wound in His Heart, the source from which flows the great wave of mercy poured out on humanity.</p></i>"

He wants us to realize that since the Eucharist is His own Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity, it <em>is </em>the \"Fountain of Life\" (<em>Diary, </em>300). The Eucharist is Jesus, Himself, the Living God, longing to pour Himself as Mercy into our hearts.</p><p>Why would Our Lord feel the need to emphasize this? Because so many people do not really understand it. They either see no need to receive Holy Communion, or they receive it simply out of habit. As St. Paul explains in his letter to the Corinthians, they eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, \"without recognizing the body of the Lord\" (1 Cor 11:27-29).</p><p>In His revelations to St. Faustina Our Lord makes it very clear what He is offering us in Holy Communion and how much it hurts Him when we treat His presence with indifference:</p><i><p><strong>My great delight is to unite Myself with souls. [W]hen I come to a human heart in Holy Communion, My hands are full of all kinds of graces which I want to give to the soul. But souls do not even pay any attention to Me; they leave Me to Myself and busy themselves with other things. Oh, how sad I am that souls do not recognize Love! They treat Me as a dead object </strong>(1385; also see 1288 and 1447).</p></i><p>So, our  Lord's promise of complete forgiveness is both a reminder and a call. It is a reminder that He is <em>truly present </em>and <em>truly alive </em>in the Eucharist, filled with love for us and waiting for us to turn to Him with trust. And it is a call for us <em>all </em>to be washed clean in His Love through Confession and Holy Communion, no matter how terrible our sins, and begin our lives again. He is offering us a new start.</p>"

                name: "Is the Promise a Plenary Indulgence?",
                description: "<p><strong>Mercy Sunday's Special Graces, Plenary Indulgence: Are They the Same?</strong><br />By Dr. Robert Stackpole, STD (Apr 9, 2010)</p><p>What is the difference between the  special grace  promised by Jesus for devout communicants on Mercy Sunday, and the plenary indulgence for Mercy Sunday devotions that was instituted several years ago by Pope John Paul II? Are they the same thing? Or are they different?</p><p>Simply put: They are NOT the same thing!</p><p>The main difference, of course, is that an \"indulgence\" is something offered to the faithful by the Church, as the keeper of the keys of the kingdom, with authority to \"bind and loose\" (see Mt 16:17-19). The special graces of Mercy Sunday, on the other hand, were promised directly by our Lord, through a prophetic revelation given to St. Faustina (see <em>Diary of St. Faustina</em>, 699). The Church has not officially ruled that this particular promise was an authentic supernatural revelation (and no Catholic is required to believe it as a matter of faith), but the Church has discerned, in various ways, that there is nothing that violates Catholic doctrine in this promise.</p><p>Briefly, here are the other main differences between the \"special graces\" promised by Jesus for Divine Mercy Sunday, and the plenary indulgence offered by the Church for special devotions to The Divine Mercy on Mercy Sunday:</p><p>1) The special graces that our Lord promised for Mercy Sunday come solely through the reception of Holy Communion on that day, in a state of grace, with trust in The Divine Mercy. Any plenary indulgence granted by the Church, on the other hand, involves the fulfilment of a number of conditions, including prayer for the pope's intentions, confession and Holy Eucharist, and the carrying out of the special indulgenced work (in this case: participating in public devotions to The Divine Mercy on Mercy Sunday itself).</p><p>2) The special graces promised by our Lord for Mercy Sunday can be received by a soul in a state of grace, but with imperfect love for God, and imperfect contrition for sin, as long as the soul merely trusts in the  mercy of God, and clings to Him because of His promised benefits. A plenary indulgence, however, can only be obtained through the performance of an indulgenced work as an expression of pure love for God. If the intentions of one's indulgenced work are not pure (say, the work is done in part out of fear of hell or purgatory, and loathing for oneself, or the desire to impress one's friends and relatives, rather than purely out of love for God) then the indulgence obtained will be only partial, not plenary.</p><p>3) The special graces that our Lord promised for Mercy Sunday can only be received for oneself, through the devout reception of Holy Communion on Mercy Sunday (as stated in #1 above). A plenary indulgence, however, can be offered for oneself, or for souls suffering in purgatory.</p><p>4) The most special grace promised by our Lord for Mercy Sunday is nothing less than the equivalent of a complete renewal of baptismal grace in the soul: \"complete forgiveness (remission) of sins and punishment.\" Such a measure of grace can only be received otherwise through baptism itself, or through making a sacramental confession as an act of perfect contrition for sin, out of pure love for God.</p><p>As you can see, this is no easy topic. However, you can find a more in-depth treatment of this same subject in the document entitled \"<a href=\"http://thedivinemercy.org/assets/pdf/jpii/UnderstandDM.pdf\">Understanding Divine Mercy Sunday</a>.\"</p>"

As Cardinal Francis Macharski, then Archbishop of Cracow, Poland, explains in a 1985 pastoral letter, we are not simply called to ask for God's mercy with trust. We are also called to <em>be </em>merciful:</p><i><p>Our own merciful attitude is likewise a preparation. Without deeds of mercy, our devotion would not be real. For Christ does not only reveal the mercy of God, but at the same time He places before people the demand that they conduct themselves in life with love and mercy. Pope John Paul II states that this requirement constitutes the very heart of the Gospel <em>ethos </em>(<em>Rich in Mercy</em>, 3) it is the commandment of love and the promise: \"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy\" (Mt 5:7). Let it be a mercy that is forgiving and true, and universal, with good words, deeds, and prayer for others!</p></i><p>Our Lord's words to St. Faustina about this requirement to be merciful are very strong and leave no room for misinterpretation:</p><i><p><strong>Yes, the first Sunday after Easter is the Feast of Mercy, but there must also be acts of mercy. \"I demand from you deeds of mercy, which are to arise out of love for Me. You are to show mercy to your neighbors always and everywhere. You must not shrink from this or try to excuse or absolve yourself from it </strong>(742).\"</p></i><p>Thus, to fittingly observe Divine Mercy Sunday in a solemn way, we should:</p><br /><b>1.  </b> <strong>Celebrate</strong> the Feast on the Sunday after Easter;<br /><b>2.  </b> Sincerely <strong>repent</strong> of all our sins;<br /><b>3.  </b> Place our <strong>complete trust</strong> in Jesus;<br /><b>4.  </b> Go to <strong>Confession</strong>, preferably before that Sunday;<br /><b>5.  </b> Receive <strong>Holy Communion</strong> on the day of the Feast;<br /><b>6.  </b> <strong>Venerate the Image</strong> of The Divine Mercy (To venerate a sacred image or statue simply means to perform some act or make some gesture of deep religious respect toward it because of the person whom it represents, in this case, our Most Merciful Savior.);<br /><b>7.  </b> <strong>Be merciful</strong> to others, through our actions, words, and prayers on their behalf.<strong></strong><br />"

                description: "<p>Three to four o'clock in the afternoon is the Hour of Great Mercy. Jesus promised St. Faustina that during this hour He would give extraordinary graces to whomever might ask for them. So that we don't let such an amazing opportunity pass us by, let's get the \"three o'clock habit\" and tap into these great graces. Before reading suggestions for how we might do this, let's first read Jesus' actual words to Faustina on this topic.</p><p>Jesus spoke to Faustina about the Hour of Great Mercy on two separate occasions. On the first occasion, he said:</p><p><strong>At three o'clock, implore My mercy, especially for sinners; and, if only for a brief moment, immerse yourself in My Passion, particularly in My abandonment at the moment of agony. This is the hour of great mercy for the whole world. I will allow you to enter into My mortal sorrow. In this hour, I will refuse nothing to the soul that makes a request of Me in virtue of My Passion </strong>(1320). </p><p>On the second occasion, Jesus spoke at greater length about this special time of grace:</p><p><strong>I remind you, My daughter, that as often as you hear the clock strike the third hour, immerse yourself completely in My mercy, adoring and glorifying it; invoke its omnipotence for the whole world, and particularly for poor sinners; for at that moment mercy was opened wide for every soul. In this hour you can obtain everything for yourself and for others for the asking; it was the hour of grace for the whole world, mercy triumphed over justice. My daughter, try your best to make the Stations of the Cross in this hour, provided that your duties permit it; and if you are not able to make the Stations of the Cross, then at least step into the chapel for a moment and adore, in the Blessed Sacrament, My Heart, which is full of mercy; and should you be unable to step into the chapel, immerse yourself in prayer there where you happen to be, if only for a very brief instant </strong>(1572).<strong></strong></p><p>In light of these two passages, let's consider three ways by which we can take advantage of the amazing graces available to us every day during the Hour of Great Mercy. We can choose the way or ways that work best for us.</p><p><u>First way</u>: We can immerse ourselves in the Lord's Passion, especially in his abandonment on the Cross. We can do this briefly, even \"for an instant\" or a longer period of time. If our duties allow us only a brief moment, we can simply call to mind an image of Jesus on the Cross or look at a crucifix or a picture of Jesus. We can also pray the \"Three O'clock Hour Prayer\" from the <em>Diary of St. Faustina</em>:</p><p>You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us. O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You (186, 1319).</p><p>If we have more time, we can pray the sorrowful mysteries of the Rosary or make the Stations of the Cross. Jesus told St. Faustina to try her best to make the Stations of the Cross during the three o'clock hour. Here's an idea for those who want to make the stations but don't have time because of other duties. First, pick one of the fourteen stations and keep it at the back of your mind as you work during the three o'clock hour, thinking about it from time to time. Then, meditate on the next station during the next day in the same way, and so on. The following list, which assigns a day of the week to each station (in two cycles), may be helpful to those who want to use this method:</p><p>(<em>Week One</em>)<br />Sunday: I. Jesus is condemned to death.<br />Monday: II. Jesus takes up his Cross.<br />Tuesday: III. Jesus falls the first time.<br />Wednesday: IV. Jesus meets his blessed mother.<br />Thursday: V. Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus to carry his Cross.<br />Friday: VI. Veronica wipes the face of Jesus.<br />Saturday: VII. Jesus falls a second time.</p><p>(<em>Week Two</em>)<br />Sunday: VIII. Jesus consoles the women of Jerusalem.<br />Monday: IX. Jesus falls the third time.<br />Tuesday: X. Jesus is stripped of his garments.<br />Wednesday: XI. Jesus is nailed to the Cross.<br />Thursday: XII. Jesus dies on the Cross.<br />Friday: XIII. Jesus is laid in the arms of his blessed mother.<br />Saturday: XIV. Jesus is laid in the tomb.</p><p><u>Second way</u>: We can confidently present our petitions to the Father by virtue of his Son's Passion. In particular, we can invoke God's mercy on the whole world and especially on unrepentant sinners. The Lord's promise that he would grant everything we ask for ourselves and for others during the three o'clock hour should help us to pray during it with great boldness and confidence. Of course, God always hears our prayers, but during the three o'clock hour, he has promised to be especially generous. It's a perfect time to pray for others and a great idea to do so through the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, which only takes about seven minutes. While we can surely pray for ourselves and for our family and friends during the Hour of Great Mercy, let's not forget to pray also for those who need it most: unrepentant sinners and the dying.</p><p><u>Third way</u>: We can visit Jesus, truly present in the Blessed Sacrament. Jesus asked St. Faustina (provided that her duties allowed it) to go to the chapel during the Hour of Great Mercy and adore his Eucharistic Heart, which is full of mercy. Of course, for most of us, it won't always be easy to visit a church or chapel during this hour. Still, if we have the time and an opportunity, for example, if while running errands we pass by a Catholic church, we just might want to pay Jesus a visit.</p>"
